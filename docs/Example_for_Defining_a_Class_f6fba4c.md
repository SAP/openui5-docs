## Example for Defining a Class

Full example of a class definition, including JSDoc

``` js
sap.ui.define(["sap/ui/base/Object", "sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel"], function (BaseObject, JSONModel) {
 
    // declare and document the constructor function
 
    /**
     * Some short sentence that summarizes the functionality of the class.
     *
     * A more detailed explanation of the class that might consist of multiple sentences
     * and paragraphs. It is <i>possible</i> to use <code>XHTML</code> <b>markup</b>
     * but this should be used only rarely, as it makes the doclet harder to read
     * in the JS editor.
     *
     * Paragraphs that are separated by empty lines will be formatted as separate
     * paragraphs in the final JSDOC documentation. This makes the addition of
     * <p> or <br/> tags unnecessary.
     *
     * It is possible to reference members of this class (like {@link #ownMethod})
     * or even of other classes (like {@link sap.ui.Object#destroy}). But be careful:
     * in contrast to JavaDoc, the signature (parameters) of a method must not be
     * included with the @link tag, only the name of the method (as !JavaScript does not support
     * method overloading).
     *
     * @class (mandatory) Marks the function as a constructor (defining a class).
     * @param {string} sId Documentation of constructor parameters.
     * @param {object} [mProperties=null] For optional parameters, the name is enclosed
     *                  in square brackets.
     *                  A default value can be appended with a '='.
     * @param {string} [mProperties.text] Even members of a configuration parameter
     *                 can be configured.
     * @see (optional, multiple) Fully qualified HTTP links to external documentation
     *                 are also possible.
     *
     * @public|@private - (optional) Declares the class as public or private (default).
     * @author (optional, multiple) Author is referenced by user Id, not by name.
     *                              Multiple authors are possible, order is
     *                              significant (first named author is the default
     *                              contact).
     * @since (optional) When the class/function has been introduced.
     * @extends sap.ui.base.Object Documents the inheritance relationship.
     * @name foo.bar.MyClass (Mandatory when defining a class with extend).
     */
    var Foo = BaseObject.extend("foo.bar.MyClass", /** @lends foo.bar.MyClass */ {
 
      constructor: function(sId, mProperties) {
 
        // init and document members here
        /**
         * The ID of a MyClass.
         *
         * @private
         */
        this.mId = sId || Utils.createGUID();
      },
     
      // now add further methods to that prototype
      /**
       * Again a summary in one sentence.
       *
       * More details can be documented, when the method is more complex.
       * @param {string} sMethod The same mechanism as above can be used to
       *                         document the parameters.
       * @param {object} [oListener] An optional parameter. If empty, the
       *                             <code>window</code> is used instead.
       * @experimental Since 1.24 Behavior might change.
       * @public
       */
      ownMethod: function(sMethod, oListener) {
     
        // ... impl
      },
 
      /**
       * A private method.
       *
       * Every member with a doc comment is included in the public JSDOC.
       * So we explicitly declare this as a private member:
       *
       * Additionally, using an underscore prefix prevents this method
       * from being added to the public facade.
       *
       * @private
       */
      _myVeryPrivateMethod: function() {
      }
     
    });
 
    // return the module value, in this example a class
    return Foo;
});
```

***

### Virtual Methods

``` js
/**
 * A 'virtual' method, that doesn't exist in this class but should be declared
 * in subclasses.
 * 
 * It is even possible to document things that aren't there. Only useful use
 * case is the documentation of abstract methods.
 * 
 * @name foo.bar.MyClass.prototype.abstractMethod
 * @function
 * @protected
 */
```

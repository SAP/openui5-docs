**Code Coverage Powered by `Istanbul`**

OpenUI5 already provides a deep integration of `QUnit` and code coverage measurement. We now introduce `Istanbul` as a modern JavaScript code instrumenter, which is intended to eventually replace the former, now legacy solution based on `Blanket.js`.

To start taking advantage of the more future-proof and feature-rich `Istanbul` solution, see the updated [code coverage documentation](Code_Coverage_Measurement_7ef3242.md).

**OpenUI5 Date and Time Formatting**

The new version of OpenUI5 introduces the following formatting features:

-   You can now centrally configure calendar week numbering via the new `calendarWeekNumbering` configuration parameter. Note that the `calendarWeekNumbering` format option introduced with OpenUI5 1.108 for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat` overrules the central configuration.

    For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](Configuration_Options_and_URL_Parameters_91f2d03.md).

-   We provide the new `intervalDelimiter` format option for `sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat`. If an `intervalDelimiter` is set, the locale-specific rules for displaying a range as defined in the Common Locale Data Repository are overruled; the two parts of the range are formatted individually, and the given delimiter is used.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now delete nested transient records that were created using the experimental Deep Create feature provided with OpenUI5 1.112. Any initial data handed over to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#create` can now contain nested entities.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding/methods/create).

-   In read-only scenarios, you can now combine the experimental hierarchy feature introduced with OpenUI5 1.105 with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getKeepAliveContext` data synchronization methods described in [Data Reuse](Data_Reuse_648e360.md).

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`setKeepAlive`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/setKeepAlive) and [`getKeepAliveContext`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/getKeepAliveContext).

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#resetChanges` API introduced as an experimental feature with OpenUI5 1.109 is now generally available.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/resetChanges).

**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

You can now prevent the activation of a new inactive entity by using `sap.ui.base.Event#preventDefault` in the handler of the `createActivate` event of an `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. Note that user input into inactive rows is regarded as a pending change by `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#hasPendingChanges`; it can be reset using `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges`.

For more information, see the API Reference for [`hasPendingChanges`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/hasPendingChanges), [`resetChanges`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel/methods/resetChanges), and [`Event.preventDefault`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.base.Event/methods/preventDefault).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   Using the new `customStateIcon` property, you can now set custom state-icons for the items in Table, List, and Object cards. Before this change, states like `Error`, `Warning`, `Success`, or `Information`, only had default icons. For more information, see the [Table Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/visibleColumns) in the Card Explorer.

-   Integration cards now support the `IllustratedMessage` control to provide more informative and consistent error messages. When the application is in debug mode \(when the URL parameter `sap-ui-debug=true` is set\), the *Show More* button opens a dialog with relevant additional \(more technical\) information.

-   We have enhanced the Table card with several new properties:

    -   You can use the new `highlight` property to show the state of each table row. Additionally, the `highlightText` property conveys the semantic of this state for better accessibility.
    -   The `additionalText` property gives you the option to display additional text in the table identifier column.

    For more information, see the [Table Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/table) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/table/highlight) in the Card Explorer.

## Right-to-Left Support

OpenUI5 application developers need to be aware of how applications behave when right-to-left \(RTL\) directionality is selected. Changing the directionality has a big impact on text-displaying controls, images and the alignment of the whole application.

The default text direction is left-to-right \(LTR\). This can be changed to right-to-left mode \(RTL\) by using one of the following configuration switches:

-   URL parameter `sap-ui-rtl=true`

-   Configuration object: `window["sap-ui-config"].rtl = true;` 

-   Script tag configuration: `data-sap-ui-rtl="true"` 

-   Setting an RTL language as default language for the application.


OpenUI5 then sets the overall page direction to RTL. All OpenUI5 content is then displayed in RTL mode. Self-written controls and content has to be tested separately. If you require manual styles, provide a style specifically for the RTL case by using `html[dir=rtl]`.

Languages with right-to-left \(RTL\) text directionality keep the default directionality of numeric values and texts in left-to-right \(LTR\) mode. To ensure correct handling, two API properties have been introduced - `textDirection` and `textAlign`.

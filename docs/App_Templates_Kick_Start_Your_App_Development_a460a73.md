## App Templates: Kick Start Your App Development

The app templates documented here are a kind of "best practice" for your app development.

They incorporate our latest recommendations and can be used for example as a starting point for developing apps. They include generic application functionality and tests that can be easily extended with custom functionality if needed.

There are separate templates for the **Worklist** and **Master-Detail** application patterns, which are closely aligned with the SAP Fiori design guidelines. The subsections of this chapter explain the concepts and features of each of these templates. See the  [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/).

> ### Note:  
> These templates were primarily created for developing SAP Fiori apps in accordance with the SAP Fiori design guidelines, but can also be used in any other OpenUI5 context.

The basic template serves as a starting point when you want to start from scratch, but also want to make sure that everything is set up properly.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We have added the experimental `$$separate` binding parameter to `ODataListBinding`, which allows you to load properties with a longer loading time in a separate request. At the moment, only navigation properties can be specified in `$$separate`. Note that this parameter must not be used in productive applications yet.

-   We now support filtering by aggregated properties. For more information, see [Filtering](Data_Aggregation_and_Recursive_Hierarchy_7d91431.md#loio7d914317c0b64c23824bf932cc8a4ae1__section_DAF).

**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

We now provide the `sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel#getFunctionImportParameterContext` method, which provides the parameter context for `sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel#getODataValueLists`. This enables the lazy loading of value list metadata of function import parameters.

For more information, see the API Reference for [`ODataMetaModel#getFunctionImportParameterContext`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel%23methods/getFunctionImportParameterContext) and [`ODataMetaModel#getODataValueLists`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.ODataMetaModel%23methods/getODataValueLists).

-   We have adapted and tidied up the structure of the context menu of group headers \(for example, we have added submenus\). In addition, the mobile menu button for group headers has been removed.

-   We have tidied up the interactive row count mode and the related entities: We have aligned the visual design of the resizer with the `sap.ui.layout.Splitter` control and improved the interaction, for example, the auto-resize and some missing keyboard shortcuts. We have also added the `maxRowCount` property with a default value. To improve accessibility, we have also added ARIA roles and attributes. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.table.rowmodes.Interactive%23overview) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.RowModes).
-   We have added the `scrollThreshold` property to the controls. It resembles the existing `threshold` property , but it is only used for scrolling. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.table.Table%23methods/setScrollThreshold).

For more information, see the [Combo Box Filter](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/filters/comboBox) section and [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/comboBoxFilter/dynamicFilterSelectedIndex) in the Card Explorer.

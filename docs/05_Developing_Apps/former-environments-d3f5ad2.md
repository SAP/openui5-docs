## SAP Web IDE

SAP Web IDE is a web-based development environment that is optimized for developing OpenUI5 complex apps using the latest innovations, developing and extending SAP Fiori apps, developing mobile hybrid apps, and extending SAP Web IDE with plug-ins and templates.

***

### Current Status

SAP Web IDE can still be used if you have a productive SAP Business Technology Platform global account and have activated SAP Web IDE there.

> ### Note:  
> It is no longer possible to access SAP Web IDE via a SAP BTP free tier account.

It is recommended to use SAP Business Application Studio instead. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).

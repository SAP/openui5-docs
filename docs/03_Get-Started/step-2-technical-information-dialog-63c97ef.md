## Step 2: Technical Information Dialog

In this tutorial step, we will have a closer look at the "Technical Information Dialog". This tool comes in handy whenever you want to know the technical details of the running application, and also has some other useful features.

### Opening the Example App and the Technical Information Dialog

1.  Download the example app with errors from the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01) and run the app.

2.  Open the *Technical Information Dialog* by pressing [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [Left-Alt\] /[Left-Option\] + [P\] .


The dialog box shows information related to the app and provides access to additional support options.

### Checking the OpenUI5 Version

When you run into problems with your app, you should check the OpenUI5 version that you're using. The feature that you want to use may not be available in your version or may have some bugs that are already solved in a later version.

1.  Check the displayed version information for the

    *OpenUI5 Version*.

2.  Open the version overview at [https://sdk.openui5.org/versionoverview.html](https://sdk.openui5.org/versionoverview.html) to see if there are newer patch levels or releases of OpenUI5.

3.  Read the [What's New](../01_Whats-New/what-s-new-in-openui5-99ac68a.md) section in the documentation and check the [Change Log](https://ui5.sap.com/#releasenotes.html) to find information about new features and bug fixes.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can view a specific version of the Demo Kit by adding the version number to the URL, for example, `https://sdk.openui5.org/1.38.8/`.


For more information, see [Versioning and Maintenance of OpenUI5](../02_Read-Me-First/versioning-and-maintenance-of-openui5-91f0214.md).

### Checking the Device

The device on which you run the app may not be supported or might be detected incorrectly by OpenUI5. This can lead to issues with responsiveness or device adaption.

1.  Verify that the *User Agent* shown in the dialog box matches your device, browser, and operating system. If the information is truncated because there is not enough space, you can see the full string as a tooltip. To copy the information, use the *Copy technical information to clipboard* button.

2.  Test the functionality on another device or by using the device emulation features that are offered in the developer tools of your browser.




### Turning On Debug Sources

The OpenUI5 libraries are included in your app in a compressed form. To be able to efficiently debug these libraries, they have to be reloaded in their source format and with developer comments.

1.  Select the *Use Debug Sources* checkbox and confirm reloading the app.

2.  Open the developer tools of your browser

3.  Choose [Crtl\] + [O\]  and type the name of an OpenUI5 framework artifact to display its source code in debug mode.

    > ### Note:  
    > You may see additional errors and warnings in the developer console. These can help you investigate the problem further.
    > 
    > For performance reasons, you should deactivate this feature again when you're done.


You can also select debug mode only for specific packages:

1.  Next to the *Use Debug Sources* checkbox, choose *Select specific modules* to open the selection dialog box.

2.  Select one or more modules in the module tree and notice that the value of the input field changes accordingly.

3.  Apply the selection and reload the app.


Only the selected modules are now loaded in debug mode.

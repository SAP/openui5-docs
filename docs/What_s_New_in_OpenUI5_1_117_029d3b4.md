**Deprecations**

We have deprecated the following entities for `sap.ui.table*`:

-   `sap.ui.table.ColumnMenu` and `sap.ui.table.AnalyticalColumnMenu`

-   `menu` aggregation of `Column`

-   `columnMenuOpen` event of `Column`
-   `columnVisibilityMenuSorter` property of `AnalyticalTable`

-   `showColumnVisibilityMenu` property of `Table`

-   `columnVisibility` event of `Table`

Instead of the deprecated `ColumnMenu`, you can use the `sap.m.table.columnmenu.Menu` control.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.table.columnmenu.Menu) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.Menus).

**`sap.ui.mdc.Table` \(experimental\)**

Refreshing table data via binding might be required if it has been changed in the back end. For example, a user might have selected *Go* in the filter bar without actually changing any filter settings. To evaluate whether the binding needs to be refreshed, even if `bindingInfo` has not changed, the `TableDelegate` uses the new `updateBinding` parameter `mSettings.forceRefresh`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/module:sap/ui/mdc/TableDelegate%23methods/sap/ui/mdc/TableDelegate.updateBinding).

**Modern ECMAScript Support in OpenUI5**

Since OpenUI5 1.116, the framework leverages features of modern ECMAScript up to and including [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/). There are certain restrictions you have to consider when using modern ECMAScript with your UI5 project.

For more information, see [ECMAScript Support](ECMAScript_Support_0cb44d7.md). Please also make sure to [upgrade your tools for modern ECMAScript in UI5](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/24/upgrade-your-tools-for-modern-ecmascript-in-ui5/).

**Theme-Dependent Custom Icon Fonts**

You can now configure variants of a custom icon font for different UI5 themes; previously, a custom icon font was applied to all themes. With an enhanced version of the metadata JSON file associated with an icon font, you can provide theme-dependent path configuration. For instance, this allows you to easily differentiate between custom icons for modern themes, such as SAP Horizon, and custom icons for older themes.

For more information and an example, see [Icon and Icon Pool](Icon_and_Icon_Pool_21ea0ea.md).

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We now provide `withCredentials` as an experimental model parameter.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

-   **Experimental:** You can now create a nested single entity behind a single-valued navigation property in the transient entity.

    For more information, see *Nested Single Entity* in [Deep Create](Creating_an_Entity_c9723f8.md#loioc9723f8265f644af91c0ed941e114d46__section_DCR).

-   Support for read-only hierarchies is now available.

    For more information, see [Recursive Hierarchy](Data_Aggregation_and_Recursive_Hierarchy_7d91431.md#loio7d914317c0b64c23824bf932cc8a4ae1__section_RCH).

If you use this flag in your applications, we recommend that you replace it with the new method. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.Menu/methods/isOpen).

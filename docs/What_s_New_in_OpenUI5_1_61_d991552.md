**Enabling Applications to Comply with the Content Security Policy \(CSP\)**

The OpenUI5 framework now allows you to run applications in an environment in which CSP has been enabled. Inline scripts are not required anymore, but you must still allow `eval()` for OpenUI5 to run. For details about the supported policies, and for recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](Content_Security_Policy_fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> An application needs to be prepared to the used policy to run in a CSP-enabled environment.

<code><b><code>sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar</code></b></code>

The `sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar` is a new control designed to display the schedule of a single resource. It can display three types of time intervals - a single day, a work week, or a full week. You can add custom actions to facilitate the interaction with the control.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#refresh` is supported for the bound context and the return value context of `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`.

-   You can now use `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#requestSideEffects` to load side effects when implicit loading is switched off via the binding-specific parameter `$$patchWithoutSideEffects`. This method must only be called on the bound context of a context binding, or on the return value context of an operation binding. With OpenUI5 1.61, there is only basic support for :n navigations, that is, the complete context is refreshed.

-   For the calculation of the path for reading data, relative bindings use the path of the context instead of the canonical path. The creation of a new entity uses the deep path as well. Use the `$$canonicalPath` binding-specific parameter to switch to the old behavior.


Note that we have introduced this change to support message processing.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

As the user types in the input field, the first matching item from the suggestions list gets highlighted. Matching text is based on the beginning of the first word entered in the input field. An autocompleted value can be accepted by pressing [Enter\].

**Demo Apps/Tutorials**

We have adapted all demo apps and tutorials to the latest UI5 evolution recommendations and concepts, including:

-   Adapting to the modular core
-   Loading all resources asynchronously
-   Replacing deprecated APIs
-   Updating automated testing recommendations
-   Removing inline scripts in HTML pages

Some of these concepts use new APIs that have been available since OpenUI5 release 1.60.

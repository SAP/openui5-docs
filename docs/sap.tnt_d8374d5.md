This library contains controls that provide the basic structure of a tool app.

The goal of these controls is to ensure consistency of the user interfaces in the tools area and the implementation of a common design language of applications and tools on the basis of SAP Fiori.

> Note:
> This set of controls described in this article has been designed exclusively for the SAP tool landscape for the SAP Cloud Platform.
> 
> Do not use these controls in regular SAP Fiori applications. This highly specialized set of controls targets the specific needs of the tools user group \(typically developers and administrators\).

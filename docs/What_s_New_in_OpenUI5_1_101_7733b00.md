**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

The new `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#delete` method deletes a binding's `Context` irrespective of its status, including inactive, transient, and persisted contexts.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context%23methods/delete).

 **OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 



</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We now support the setting of a different binding context for a relative list binding with transient contexts.

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper#format` now evaluates the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation of properties of the `Edm.DateTimeOffset` type. A composite binding with an `sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone` type is generated, showing the date/time and the time zone. For more information, see [AnnotationHelper](Meta_Model_for_OData_V4_7f29fb3.md#loio7f29fb3ce5964d8090038a9d3cdf5060__section_AnnoHelp).

-   We provide a new sample application that demonstrates how data in different controls can be kept in sync. The application also shows important aspects of consuming a draft-enabled back-end service.For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.Draft).

**`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.m.Tree`**

For better user experience with a more visual approach and a more conversational tone, these tables can now use another control, for example, the `sap.m.IllustratedMessage` control, based on the new `noData` aggregation. This control can be used if no data is available for a table. For more information, see the [API Reference for the `noData` aggregation](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.ListBase) and the [API Reference for `IllustratedMessage`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.IllustratedMessage).

# Theming

Theming is an important aspect when developing a new control.

People with visual impairments and people using the application under less than ideal circumstances \(bad monitor, sunlight hitting the screen, window reflections\) may not be able to read the text easily if the contrast levels are insufficient.

When implementing new control, consider adding support for the different themes and check the color contrast between the elements. The different colors shown on the UI need to have a good contrast to each other in order to be easily distinguishable.

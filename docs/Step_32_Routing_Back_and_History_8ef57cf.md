## Step 32: Routing Back and History

Now we can navigate to our detail page and display an invoice, but we cannot go back to the overview page yet. We'll add a back button to the detail page and implement a function that shows our overview page again.

### Coding

You can view and download all files at [Walkthrough - Step 32](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.m.tutorial.walkthrough.32/preview).

``` xml
<mvc:View
	controllerName="sap.ui.demo.walkthrough.controller.Detail"
	xmlns="sap.m"
	xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc">
	<Page
		title="{i18n>detailPageTitle}"
		*HIGHLIGHT START*showNavButton="true"
		navButtonPress=".onNavBack">*HIGHLIGHT END*
		<ObjectHeader
			intro="{invoice>ShipperName}"
			title="{invoice>ProductName}"/>
	</Page>
</mvc:View>
```

On the detail page, we tell the control to display a back button by setting the parameter `showNavButton` to true and register an event handler that is called when the back button is pressed.

***

### webapp/controller/Detail.controller.js

``` js
sap.ui.define([
	"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller",
*HIGHLIGHT START*	"sap/ui/core/routing/History"*HIGHLIGHT END*
], function (Controller*HIGHLIGHT START*, History*HIGHLIGHT END*) {
	"use strict";

	return Controller.extend("sap.ui.demo.walkthrough.controller.Detail", {

		onInit: function () {
			var oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();
			oRouter.getRoute("detail").attachPatternMatched(this._onObjectMatched, this);
		},

		_onObjectMatched: function (oEvent) {
			this.getView().bindElement({
				path: "/" + window.decodeURIComponent(oEvent.getParameter("arguments").invoicePath),
				model: "invoice"
			});
		}*HIGHLIGHT START*,

		onNavBack: function () {
			var oHistory = History.getInstance();
			var sPreviousHash = oHistory.getPreviousHash();

			if (sPreviousHash !== undefined) {
				window.history.go(-1);
			} else {
				var oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();
				oRouter.navTo("overview", {}, true);
			}
		}
*HIGHLIGHT END*
	});
});

```

We load a new dependency that helps us to manage the navigation history from the `sap.ui.core.routing` namespace and add the implementation for the event handler to our detail page controller.

In the event handler we access the navigation history and try to determine the previous hash. In contrast to the browser history, we will get a valid result only if a navigation step inside our app has already happened. Then we will simply use the browser history to go back to the previous page. If no navigation has happened before, we can tell the router to go to our overview page directly. The third parameter `true` tells the router to replace the current history state with the new one since we actually do a back navigation by ourselves. The second parameter is an empty array \(`{}`\) as we do not pass any additional parameters to this route.

This implementation is a bit better than the browserâ€™s back button for our use case. The browser would simply go back one step in the history even though we were on another page outside of the app. In the app, we always want to go back to the overview page even if we came from another link or opened the detail page directly with a bookmark. You can try it by loading the detail page in a new tab directly and clicking on the back button in the app, it will still go back to the overview page.

***

### Conventions

-   Add a path to go back to the parent page when the history state is unclear.

We want to rate the product shown on the detail page, so we create a composition of multiple standard controls using the OpenUI5 extension mechanism and add some glue code to make them work nicely together. This way, we can reuse the control across the app and keep all related functionality in one module.")

## File Names and Encoding

Some target platforms of OpenUI5 impose technical restrictions on the naming or structure of resources \(files\).For this, rules for file names and encoding have been introduced.

When developing content for OpenUI5, adhere to the following rules:

-   Folder names must **not** contain spaces.

-   To avoid issues with the OpenUI5 module loading and with URL handling in general, resource names should **not** contain spaces.

-   Single folder names must **not** be longer than 40 characters.

-   Two resource names must **not** only differ in case.

-   Avoid non-ASCII characters in resource names.

## Developing Controls

You can create own content for OpenUI5. To develop controls in JavaScript, you can either extend existing controls or create new ones.

> ### Note:  
> If you want to contribute to OpenUI5, you have to consider our guidelines and recommendations with regard to, for example, product standards, file names and encoding.

As a control developer, you create or modify UI libraries and their pieces, i.e. controls and types. You define the set of properties your control provides as well as events or aggregations. A major task is the implementation of a control-specific renderer, which knows how to create suitable HTML markup for a given control instance, taking its current state into account. A renderer is written in JavaScript and produces HTML output which is styled by means of CSS. Such style sheets are another important part of a UI library.

Controls can be defined on the fly without a library definition or running generation steps. These controls are also called notepad controls.

When you want to develop several controls for reuse in different applications, we recommend creating a control library instead of using these notepad controls. Control libraries have additional features such as automatic support for theming and right-to-left languages, but the implementation of the controls is the same as for notepad controls.

> ### Note:  
> This functionality is not restricted to controls. It can also be used to create or extend arbitrary objects, such as components, that are derived from `sap.ui.base.ManagedObject`. For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.base.ManagedObject`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.html).

To keep the OpenUI5 code readable and maintainable, development conventions and guidelines are introduced. We strongly recommend that you follow these guidelines even if you find them violated somewhere. For files that are consistently **not** following these rules and for which adhering to the rules would make the code worse, follow the local style. If you want to contribute your content to OpenUI5, you **have to** follow these conventions and guidelines.

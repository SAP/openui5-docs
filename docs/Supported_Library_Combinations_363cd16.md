[Deprecated Themes and Libraries](Deprecated_Themes_and_Libraries_a87ca84.md "As OpenUI5 evolves over time, some of the UI controls are replaced by others, or their concepts abandoned entirely. This chapter gives an overview on theme and library level of the most important deprecations. Individual control deprecations and more information about the controls replacing them can be found in the API reference within the Demo Kit.")

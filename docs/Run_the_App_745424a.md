## Run the App

SAP Web IDE comes with integrated testing features that let you run the app on a central server without having to set up any additional infrastructure. You can run the app by selecting the `src/index.html` file and clicking the *run* button in the header toolbar.

> ### Caution:  
> SAP Web IDE is no longer available via SAP Business Technology Platform trial accounts. Any references to SAP Web IDE in this documentation are only relevant for you if you have access to SAP Web IDE through a productive SAP BTP account. Please consider SAP Business Application Studio as an alternative. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](App_Development_Using_SAP_Business_Application_Studio_6bbad66.md).

This launches the app on a central server and a testing tool that allows you to configure the screen size and orientation of the device. This feature can be used to test apps that are specifically targeted for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. You can change the resolution and the orientation in the header bar very easily.

If you don't want to run the app in the testing tool, you can adjust the *Run Configurations* for the project:

1.  Right-click any file in the project and select *Run* \> *Run Configurations*.

2.  Select *Run as Web Application* and choose + to add a new Web Application run configuration.

3.  Configure the settings as needed.
4.  To save the configuration and run your project, choose *Save and Run*.


For more information on how to run projects, search for *Configuring How to Run Projects* in the SAP Web IDE Developer Guide for the SAP Business Technology Platform on the SAP Help Portal at [https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/CP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/CP).

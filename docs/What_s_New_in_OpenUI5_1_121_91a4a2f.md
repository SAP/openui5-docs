-   To visualize which scope is affected by the context menu actions \(a single row or all selected rows\) , we have enabled the new `ContextMenuSetting` plugin. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.plugins.ContextMenuSetting).

-   We have enabled the `rememberSelections` property that stores binding paths of selections after binding updates in OData V4. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.ListBase%23methods/getRememberSelections).

We have provided copy and paste functionality that allows users to copy data in plain `text` and `html` format using the `extractDataHandler` of `sap.m.plugins.CopyProvider`. This way users can, for example, copy data in various data formats from a table to a spreadsheet and vice versa. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.plugins.CopyProvider.extractDataHandler) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.Table/sample/sap.m.sample.TableCopy).

-   In some simple scenarios, where the table is used to display information only \(read-only scenarios\), you might want to hide the toolbar of the table. To enable this, we have provided the `hideToolbar` property. See the documentation for restrictions related to this feature. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.mdc.Table%23methods/getHideToolbar).

So that delegate metadata can be easily understood, we have changed the main identifier attribute of `propertyInfo` from `name` to `key`. For compatibility reasons, we ensure that applications can still use the legacy format. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.mdc.util.PropertyInfo).

**`sap.m.p13n.Engine`**

-   We have enhanced personalization with filtering options: A filter panel is now available in the `Engine`. We have also enabled the implementation of a `FilterController`. This implementation includes variants and can be used by any control. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.p13n.Engine) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.p13n.Engine/sample/sap.m.sample.p13n.EngineCustomFilters).

-   `SinglePage` \(default\) – the user can slide pages one by one. This was the behavior until now.
-   `VisiblePages` – when there are multiple visible pages in the carousel \(visiblePagesCount property has a value greater than one\), the user can slide them all with one click.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have \(experimentally\) added a new filter of type `sap.m.ComboBox`, which supports a two-column layout. For more information, see the [Combo Box Filter](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/filters/comboBox) section and [ComboBox](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/comboBoxFilter) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced an additional option to define actions-strip buttons in a list item or in a footer. It allows you to dynamically set specific actions for each list item in the List card. They can now be defined with a template, and can be based on the fetched data from a back-end service. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section and [Dynamic Actions Strip](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/dynamicActionsStrip) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have \(experimentally\) added an option to set group labels for one or more actions-strip buttons. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section and [Actions Labels](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/actionsLabels) sample in the Card Explorer.
-   We have introduced a new `preferIcon` property for the actions-strip buttons. If set to `true`, the button in the visible area is displayed only as an icon. This feature saves space in the actions strip. For more information, see the [Actions Strip](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/actionsStrip) section in the Card Explorer.
-   The following features are no longer experimental:

    -   Search filter
    -   CSRF tokens \(with new binding syntax\)
    -   Actions strip
    -   Card footer

    For more information, see the [Learn](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/gettingStarted) section in the Card Explorer.

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the Object card to show an image with text overlay. There are multiple new properties available that you can use to control how the image is displayed and the overlay behavior of the texts. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/objectCardWithImageWithOverlay) in the Card Explorer.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now use aliases for computed annotations in XML views. Use `template:require` or `<template:alias>` during templating and `core:require` in XML views for defining your aliases. Note that we no longer recommend using global names for computed annotations in XML views or during templating.

    For more information, see [Require Modules in XML View and Fragment](Require_Modules_in_XML_View_and_Fragment_b11d853.md) and [Meta Model for OData V4](Meta_Model_for_OData_V4_7f29fb3.md).

-   You can now explicitly provide `$single` as a new group ID to`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#delete`, `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#delete`, and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute`. Requests will then be sent as fast as with `$direct`, but they will be wrapped in a batch request as with `$auto`.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.Context#delete`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/delete), [`v4.ODataModel#delete`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/delete), and [`v4.ODataContextBinding#execute`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding%23methods/execute).

**`sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow`**

We have introduced a new `rowHeaderDescription` property. As an application developer, you can use it to define the text that will be announced by screen readers when a user navigates to the row header. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow).

To improve the accessibility of the control, we have provided shorter and more user-friendly texts for screen-reader announcements of appointment durations. Now we use the full date format \(for example, “Thursday, August 17, 2023”\) instead of the short format \(“8/17/23”\). Additionally, now we use the shorter “From/To”, instead of “Start Time/End Time”.For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.SinglePlanningCalendar/sample/sap.m.sample.SinglePlanningCalendar).

You can use the new wrapping property of the `sap.m.ViewSettingsItem` control to change the item’s title text behavior from truncate \(default\) to wrapping. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.ViewSettingsItem).

The default behavior of the control is to set the widths of the side content and the main content according to the screen size. Using the new `sideContentWidthM`, `sideContentWidthL`, and `sideContentWidthXL` properties you can now override the default values for M, L, and XL display breakpoints. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.layout.DynamicSideContent).

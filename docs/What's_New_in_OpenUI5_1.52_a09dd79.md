### Improved Features

***

#### OData V2 Model

You can now optimize dependent bindings in OData V2 models. The OData V2 model now supports a `preliminaryContext` flag. When set to `true`, the OData model can bundle the OData calls for dependent bindings into fewer `$batch` requests. Two bindings are considered dependent if one cannot be resolved without the other being resolved first. For example, a relative binding cannot be resolved without a resolved absolute binding.

***

#### OpenUI5 OData V4 Model

The new version of the OpenUI5 The OData V4 model has the following features:

-   Handling of `Edm.Stream` in read-only mode

-   Possibility to declare several batch groups as `$auto` or `$direct`

-   Enhancements to the adapter to use the V4 model with an OData V2 service: handling of simple `$filter` expressions


> Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to a Bug Fix**
> 
> If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. However, due to a bug, the return value wraps the expected output and can only be accessed using `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break as of OpenUI5 version 1.44.6.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of OpenUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for the `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the `.value[0]`workaround any more.

> Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

#### Support Assistant

Support Assistant has been enhanced with the following features:

 ![](loio43f74fa14f8a4cfc82c0e31998072d6b_LowRes.png) 

-   Additional rule property *Async*

    The default value of this property is `false`. If you set it to `true`, a resolve function is passed as a parameter of the check function to allow you to resolve the asynchronous operation. Call `fnResolve` to indicate that the asynchronous check function has finished. The asynchronous function waits 10 seconds before it times out.

-   -   When you click the *Settings* button in the Support Assistant toolbar, you can see the URL at the bottom of the dialog box. A *Copy* button next to the URL allows you to copy the location to the clipboard.

-   In the *Technical Information* section of the report.

-   Displaying issues and their severity

    After an analysis run, you can see how many issues of each severity have been reported for each library. This information is also available for the individual rules. In the *Details* section for each rule, you can see a severity icon for each issue generated by that rule.

### Improved Controls

-   `sap.f.DynamicPage`:
    -   Additional visual indicators \(arrow buttons\) are now available. They are positioned either below the header \(when the header is expanded\) or below the title \(when the header is collapsed\). The expanded/collapsed state of the header can be toggled by clicking on the title or the arrow buttons. Both areas get a darker color when hovering over them. For more information, see the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.f.sample.DynamicPageFreeStyle/preview).

    -   A new area, designated for breadcrumb navigation, has been introduced at the top-left area of the title of the page. It is enabled with the new `breadcrumbs` aggregation \(type `sap.m.IBreadcrumbs`\) that belongs to `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle) and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.f.sample.DynamicPageFreeStyle/preview).

    -   The `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` has a new `navigationActions` aggregation, which is meant for buttons with navigation semantics, such as *Close*, *Full screen*, and *Exit full screen*. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle) and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.f.sample.DynamicPageFreeStyle/preview).

    -   The `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` has two new aggregations: `expandedHeading` and `snappedHeading`. They enable the app to display different content in the heading for the expanded and collapsed states of the header. The previous `heading` aggregation is not deprecated and works as a replacement for the new ones. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle).

-   `sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`:
    -   The control has a new `titleContent` aggregation and `titlePrimaryArea` property. The aggregation allows you as an app developer to place content in the middle of the title area, displayed in both expanded and collapsed \(snapped\) states of the header. The property determines which of the title areas \(`Begin`, `Middle`\) is primary \(shrinking at a lower rate, remaining visible as long as it can\). For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage) and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.f.sample.SemanticPageFreeStyle/preview).

    -   The new `navigationActions` aggregation that belongs to the `sap.f.DynamicPageTitle` is now utilized when using the `closeAction`, `fullScreenAction`, and `exitFullScreenAction` aggregations of the `SemanticPage`. The content added in the aggregations is automatically positioned in the title in an ordered way. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.f.DynamicPageTitle).

-   `sap.m.CheckBox`: A new `useEntireWidth` Boolean property determines whether the value set for the `width` property applies to the whole control or to the control label only. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.CheckBox).

-   `sap.m.DateRangeSelection`: The binding is improved and the control now supports date intervals. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.DateRangeSelection).

-   `sap.m.FeedListItem` provides new actions for defining additional features. You can find the features in an `sap.m.ActionSheet` when you press the *Action* button. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.FeedListItemAction).

-   `sap.m.MessagePage`: A new `iconAlt` property has been introduced. It enables the setting of an `alt` attribute for the icon displayed on the `sap.m.MessagePage`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.MessagePage).

-   `sap.m.MessageView` has new default behavior and a new property. These changes aim to save space on the screen and hide unnecessary controls.

    -   If only one item is available, the details page for the first item is used as the initial page after opening a `MessagePopover` or rendering a `MessageView`.

    -   If there are messages of only one type, the filtering options in the header will be hidden.

    -   A new `showDetailsPageHeader` Boolean property for hiding the details page header has been introduced. When set to `false`, no header will be displayed in the details section of the message.

    For more information, see the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.MessageViewInsideDialog/preview). 

-   `sap.m.OverflowToolbar`: Until now, controls needed to be whitelisted in a central helper class to be allowed to move to the overflow menu. With the addition of the new `sap.m.IOverflowToolbarContent` interface, each control can now provide this data on its own, without needing to be whitelisted. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.IOverflowToolbarContent).

-   `sap.m.PlanningCalendar`: There is a new `showWeekNumbers` property that enables the display of the calendar week numbers. They are available for the *Days*, *1 Week*, and *1 Month* views of the `sap.m.PlanningCalendar`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendar) and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendar/preview).

-   `sap.m.QuickView` has new default behavior. When the *QuickView* is only one page, and when no header is set, the header is no longer rendered. For more information, see the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.QuickView/preview).

-   `sap.m.RatingIndicator` has a new `editable` property. When set to `true`, the control can be edited and you can rate using the icons. When set to `false`, the rating indicator is presented in a non-interactive mode and can be used, for example, to visualize an aggregated rating score.

-   `sap.m.SegmentedButton`: After the `buttons` aggregation was deprecated in version 1.28, both the `select` event and `selectedButton` association are no longer useful for the recommended `items` aggregation. For this reason, the `select` event and `selectedButton` association are deprecated as of version 1.52 and are replaced by new ones - the `selectionChange` event and the `selectedItem` association. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.SegmentedButton) and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.SegmentedButton/preview).

-   `sap.m.Table` and `sap.ui.table.Table`: Alternate row styling is now supported with the new `alternateRowColors` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Table/overview) and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.TableAlternateRowColors/preview) for `sap.m.Table` and the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.table.Table/overview) and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.TableAlternateRowColors/preview) for `sap.ui.table.Table`. 

-   `sap.m.Table`: A new `popinLayout` property has been added that defines the layout for pop-in rows. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Table/controlProperties) and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.Table/preview).

-   `sap.m.Text` has a new `renderWhitespace` property. It specifies the rendering of whitespace characters \(`“ “`\) and tabs \(`\t`\) inside the control. The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, the browser preserves whitespace characters and tabs. Line breaks \(`\r\n`, `\n\r`, `\r`, `\n`\) are always visualized unless the `wrapping` property is set to `false`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Text) and the [Samples](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.TextRenderWhitespace/preview).

-   `sap.m.Title` has a new `wrapping` property. It determines if the title will be wrapped. The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, the entire title is wrapped. You should only activate the wrapping if the surrounding container allows flexible heights. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.Title/methods/setWrapping) and the [Samples](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.m.sample.TitleWrapping/preview).

-   `sap.tnt.NavigationList` and `sap.tnt.SideNavigation` have a new `selectedItem` association. It allows you to specify which `NavigationListItem` will be selected when you load the page and enables you to change the selected *Menu* item using the code. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.tnt.SideNavigation) and the [Samples](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.tnt.sample.SideNavigation/preview).

-   `sap.tnt.NavigationListItem` has a new `visible` property. It allows you to choose if a `NavigationListItem` will be rendered in the `NavigationList` or not. By default it is set to `true`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.tnt.NavigationListItem) and the [Samples](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.tnt.sample.NavigationList/preview).

-   `sap.ui.table.Table`: You can now use drag and drop for table rows with aggregation `dragDropConfig`. For more information, see the [API Reference for the `dragDropConfig` aggregation](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.table.Table/aggregations), the [API Reference for `sap.ui.core.dnd`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.dnd), the [Sample for `TreeTable`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.TreeTable.HierarchyMaintenanceJSONTreeBinding/preview) and the [Sample for `Table`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.DnD/preview).

-   `sap.ui.unified.FileUploader`:
    -   A new `valueStateText` property has been introduced to enable the display of custom messages when a `valueState` is set. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.unified.FileUploader).

    -   The new `xhrSettings` aggregation allows app developers to specify settings for the internally used `XMLHttpRequest` object when uploading files with `sendXHR=true`. Currently the only supported setting is `withCredentials`. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.unified.FileUploader).

    -   A new `sap.ui.unified.IProcessableBlobs` interface has been implemented and `sap.ui.unified.FileUploader` has been updated to use it. It facilitates the implementation of custom controls that extend the `sap.ui.unified.FileUploader`, for example, to modify the files before they get uploaded. To enable the feature, you need to set the `bPreProcessFiles` parameter of the `upload` method to `true`. As a result, the method becomes asynchronous. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.unified.IProcessableBlobs).

-   `sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout` now contains a new type of header. The new header is flexible and dynamic as opposed to the classic header that has a specific and predefined layout. To implement the new dynamic header, the app should provide an instance of the new `sap.uxap.ObjectPageDynamicHeaderTitle` control as the value of the `headerTitle` aggregation.

    With the new dynamic header the following features are available:

    -   General-purpose aggregations instead of semantic properties that allow you to build a custom header layout

    -   An arrow button displayed below the header content and visual indicators when hovering over the title and the arrow button

    -   The title and the arrow button can be clicked to expand or collapse the header

    -   A pin button allowing the header to remain expanded when scrolling the page or clicking/tapping the title

    -   `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` is used internally to implement the `actions` aggregation, enabling its features, such as the priority and grouping of the actions.

    For more information, see [Object Page Headers](Object_Page_Headers_d2ef009.md), the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.uxap.ObjectPageDynamicHeaderTitle), and the [sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/sample/sap.uxap.sample.ObjectPageWithDynamicHeader/preview).

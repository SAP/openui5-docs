# Contribute to the OpenUI5 Documentation

Did you spot an error in the documentation? Do you think something is missing or should be explained differently? Do you have a great idea for new content? This is the place to share your thoughts and ideas with us!

You can add **content requests** by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SAP/openui5-docs/issues). If you want to propose changes, updates, or corrections to the documentation content, please create a **pull request**.

**You are welcome to:**

* Correct or update existing documentation as needed.
* Add new content and sections to an existing article.
* Create and propose entirely new documentation chapters.
* Suggest changes to the structure of the documentation.

As with every open source project, there is no guarantee that your contributions will be accepted, but we do our best to make it happen! We might also edit and adapt your contributions before we implement them to bring them in line with our documentation standards.

**To contribute, please follow these simple steps:**

1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account.
2. Implement your contribution.
3. Create a GitHub pull request with a meaningful title.
4. A colleague from our documentation team will review your suggested changes and give feedback.
5. Once your contribution is accepted and the pull request is merged, it will be visible in the [OpenUI5 Nightly Demo Kit](https://openui5nightly.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic). With the next OpenUI5 release, these changes will also become part of the official [OpenUI5 documentation in the Demo Kit](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic).

*Have fun contributing and do let us know if we can support with anything!*

For more information, see [Currency and Unit Customizing in OData V2](OData_V2_Model_6c47b2b.md#loioaa9024c7c5444822a68daeb21a92bd51).

**OpenUI5 Data Types**

**OpenUI5 Data Types**

The `preserveDecimals` format option introduced in `sap.ui.core.format.NumberFormat` with OpenUI5 1.87 is now enabled by default, unless the `style` format option is set to either `short` or `long`. This applies to the following data types:

-   `sap.ui.model.type.Currency`
-   `sap.ui.model.type.Float`
-   `sap.ui.model.type.Unit`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Currency`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Decimal`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Double`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Single`
-   `sap.ui.model.odata.type.Unit`

This change fixes the shortcoming that displayed values can be truncated if the back end provides more decimals than accounted for on the UI. It is also a prerequisite for highlighting all instances of invalid data entered by the user if the same property is displayed in multiple places on the UI.

However, in some cases it can be necessary to display a value with fewer decimals than actually exist for the property. You would then need to add the `preserveDecimals` format option with a value of `false` to the type instance.

Similar to the `sap.m.Text` control, these controls now also implement the new `emptyIndicatorMode` property. It allows developers to display an empty text as a language dependent “-” symbol.

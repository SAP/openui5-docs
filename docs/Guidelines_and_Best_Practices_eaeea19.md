The minimum OpenUI5 version required so that the rule can produce valid results. The Support Assistant considers applicable rules according to their `minversion` value.

If you have rules in your custom library, keep in mind that the rule `minversion` will still be compared against the underlying OpenUI5 version. If you are not aware of the version, you can put in the `minversion` field "\*", "-" or whitespace \(" "\) to make sure these rules are executed.

### Check Function Guidelines

Here are some general guidelines that you should consider when creating a new rule:

-   **Create very specific rules**

    It is important that the rules are as specific as possible. Avoid too generic or unspecific rules that would produce excessive number of issues difficult to digest or follow up. The rules should focus on one issue and provide a resolution for it.

-   **Reduce the number of issues generated**

    Do not overload the user with a large number of issues. When appropriate, produce one issue where multiple texts are concatenated with `\n` delimiter.

-   **Write clear descriptions and resolutions**

    Use the guidelines in [Create a Ruleset for a Library](Create_a_Ruleset_for_a_Library_b5a5135.md)

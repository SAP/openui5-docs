## Stable IDs

Setting stable IDs is crucial if your app is used in combination with certain functions.

Most controls in the template apps \(except for aggregations that are created dynamically, such as list items\) are assigned a stable ID to identify the controls in integration tests, extensibility tools like key user adaptation, as well as interactive inline help tools.

[Stable IDs: All You Need to Know](Stable_IDs_All_You_Need_to_Know_f51dbb7.md "Stable IDs are IDs for controls, elements, or components that you set yourself in the respective id property or attribute as opposed to IDs that are generated by OpenUI5. Stable means that the IDs are concatenated with the application component ID and do not have any auto-generated parts.")

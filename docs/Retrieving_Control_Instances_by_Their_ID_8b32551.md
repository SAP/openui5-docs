## Retrieving Control Instances by Their ID

A control instance can be found in a fragment by means of its ID.

***

Due to the above prefixing that guarantees unique IDs, there are different cases possible which require different calls.

Assuming the control has the ID `myControl`, there are two ways how to retrieve it by its ID.

-   Retrieving a control instance when the fragment is not part of a view
    -   When no fragment ID was given: `myControl = sap.ui.getCore().byId("myControl")`

    -   When a fragment ID `myFrag` was given: `myControl = sap.ui.core.Fragment.byId("myFrag", "myControl")`


-   Retrieving a control instance when the fragment is embedded into a view and the code is inside a controller. The controller is called `this` in the following examples.

    -   When no fragment ID was given: `myControl = this.byId("myControl")`

    -   When a fragment ID `myFrag` was given: `myControl = this.byId(sap.ui.core.Fragment.createId("myFrag", "myControl"))`

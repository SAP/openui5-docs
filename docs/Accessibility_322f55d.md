## Accessibility

Accessibility features are essential for users with disabilities. In an ongoing approach, OpenUI5 controls aim to comply with various product standards such as screen reader support, high-contrast theming and keyboard handling.

The following topics provide important accessibility information related to OpenUI5 controls from an end-user perspective.

> ### Note:  
> This documentation describes standard accessibility functionality in OpenUI5. For specific information on accessibility in products based on OpenUI5, see the documentation for the respective product. **In case of conflict between the OpenUI5 documentation and the respective product documentation describing accessibility functionality, the respective product documentation shall prevail.** 
> 
> Note that accessibility for web applications also depends on the browser and the operating system used. For more information, see the [Accessibility Status Documents](http://experience.sap.com/archived/saps-accessibility-product-status-documents/).

The following table shows the availability of the different accessibility features.

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have made the loading placeholder for Timeline card more detailed to better reveal the expected loading content. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading).

-   We have \(experimentally\) enabled the Object card to validate the user input provided in the card form fields. As a card developer, using the available validation functions, you can now specify if the input is required, limit the number of characters, or restrict the input to some predefined options. You can also set the validation message and the validation type \(`Error`, `Warning`, or `Information`\). For more information, see the [Input Validation](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/features/inputValidation) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/formWithValidation) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have \(experimentally\) introduced new properties that enable you to format Object card content:

    -   `titleMaxLines` - limits the number of lines in which the group title will be wrapped.
    -   `labelWrapping` - a Boolean property that determines whether the labels of the group items will be wrapped.

    For more information, see the [Object Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/titleMaxLinesAndLabelWrapping) in the Card Explorer.

-   You can now control the visibility of List card item’s attributes using the new `visible` Boolean property.

    For more information, see the [List Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/list) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/attributesVisibility) in the Card Explorer.

We have introduced a new `heading` aggregation that allows you to include content, such as message strips, at the beginning of a section.

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Deactivation of Default Time Zone Configuration Feature**

We needed to deactivate the feature to configure the default time zone via the time zone configuration option in [`sap.ui.core.Configuration`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration) and the API method [`sap.ui.core.Configuration.setTimezone`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration/methods/setTimezone). Reason: There was a risk that dates are visualized by one day off. This wrong date might have been persisted to the back end.

This feature was introduced with UI5 1.102.0. The following UI5 versions still contain this feature:

-   1.102.0 to 1.102.5
-   1.103
-   1.104

If you are on one of these releases, we recommend that you upgrade to a higher version where this feature is deactivated.

Deactivated as of:

-   1.106

-   1.105

-   1.102.6


We plan to bring this feature back in a different form at a later point in time.

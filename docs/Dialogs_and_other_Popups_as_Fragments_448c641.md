## Dialogs and other Popups as Fragments

You can use fragments to declaratively define dialogs and other popup controls which are not part of the normal page UI structure.

This is a huge advantage over views that do not support this use. The main reason for this is that the view control is always a wrapper around the view content.

		a dialog control that can be used like any dialog.")**  
The fragment instantiation function always returns the fragment's root control, which is a dialog control that can be used like any dialog.

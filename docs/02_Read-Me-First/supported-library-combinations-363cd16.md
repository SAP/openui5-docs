# Supported Library Combinations

OpenUI5 provides a set of JavaScript and CSS libraries, which can be combined in an application using the combinations that are supported.



In general, most library combinations are supported. However, restrictions apply for the following libraries:

-   `sap.ui.commons` \(deprecated\)

-   `sap.ui.suite` \(deprecated\)

-   `sap.ui.ux3` \(deprecated\)


These libraries can **only** be used in combination with the following libraries:



-   `sap.ui.core`

-   `sap.ui.layout`

-   `sap.ui.unified`

-   `sap.ui.table`

[Deprecated Themes and Libraries](deprecated-themes-and-libraries-a87ca84.md "As OpenUI5 evolves over time, some of the UI controls are replaced by others, or their concepts abandoned entirely. This chapter gives an overview of the most important deprecations at theme and library level. Individual control deprecations and more information about the controls replacing them can be found in the API reference within the Demo Kit.")

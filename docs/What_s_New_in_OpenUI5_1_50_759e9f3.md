**New Demo Kit \(already available as of version 1.48.5\)**

The Demo Kit app has a new modern design that is intuitive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

The global search has been improved and the results are now displayed in categories. They also include results from the *Samples* section, which was not possible with the old Demo Kit since the *Explored* app was a decoupled app.

The new Demo Kit contains the following sections:

-   Landing page with getting started information

-   *Documentation* with detailed information

-   *API Reference* with JavaScript documentation about the framework and the UI controls, including details for the corresponding properties, aggregations, associations, events, and methods

-   *Samples*, showcasing almost all controls with ability to download the sample code

-   *Demo Apps*, showcasing real-life scenarios that can easily be downloaded

**Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \(CLDR\)**

The Unicode Common Locale Data Repository \(CLDR\) has been updated to version 31.

The correct plural category for a given number is now handled by the locale-specific plural rules offered by CLDR. Different languages use different plural forms, some languages have only singular and plural, others require additional forms, for example, dual \(two\), paucal \(few\), or many.

**Date Interval Types** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Date Interval Types**

Date interval types are introduced to format two date-related properties from a model for displaying in the UI. Additionally they are used to parse and validate the values in UI controls before they are saved back to the model. The new interval types are:

-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateInterval` - a date interval \(without time\)

-   `sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval` - a date interval with the exact point of time

-   `sap.ui.model.type.TimeInterval` - a time interval \(without date\)


For more information, see [sap.ui.model.type.DateTimeInterval](sap_ui_model_type_DateTimeInterval_94658aa.md) and the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.type).

The configuration option `animationMode` replaces `animation`, which is now deprecated. The new option supports several states \(`full`, `basic`, `minimal`, `none`\), which allow controls to extend support for animations in a more granular way instead of a binary `on`/`off` state. For more information, see [Configuration Options and URL Parameters](Configuration_Options_and_URL_Parameters_91f2d03.md), [Implementing Animation Modes](Implementing_Animation_Modes_76b7d50.md), and the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.core.Configuration.AnimationMode).

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces an adapter that allows you to use an OData V2 service together with the OData V4 model in read scenarios. The adapter offers the following features:

-   Metadata is converted, including some V2 annotations.

-   Data in the response is converted.

-   Literals in the request URI are converted, except for `Edm.DateTime`, `Edm.DateTimeOffset`, `Edm.Time`, and `Edm.Binary`.

-   `$select`, `$expand`, and `$orderby` are handled. Cases that are not supported by OData V2, like `$orderby` in `$expand`, lead to an error.

-   All unsupported query options lead to an error.


> ### Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to a Bug Fix**
> 
> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. However, due to the bug, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with OpenUI5 version 1.44.6.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of OpenUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for the `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]` any longer.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added**

<td valign="top">

**Support Assistant: OPA Test Sample Added**

With the roll-out of Support Assistant in version 1.48, we introduced the possibility to use the tool in OPA tests to check if there are issues in the different states of an application. This is possible by enabling the available OPA extension.

As of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. It demonstrates how you can extend existing OPA tests by making calls to the assertions in the Support Assistant extension. These assertions may have different severity, execution scope and subset of rules which are taken into consideration. The sample also shows how to execute rule checks and how to get reports.

As of this version, there is now a sample of the OPA integration in the Demo Kit. For more information, see [Integrating the Rules in OPA Tests](Integrating_the_Rules_in_OPA_Tests_cfabbd4.md) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.OpaWithSupportAssistant/preview).

-   With the new content aggregation of the `DynamicPageTitle`, you can add content in the middle area of the title. This content is displayed both in the expanded and collapsed states of the `DynamicPageHeader`.

**`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`**

To align with the latest SAP Fiori design guidelines, the following changes were implemented:

-   The position of the draft indicator is changed to be the first one before the finalizing actions in the footer toolbar of the page.

-   A new *Edit* button was added as the main action and the order of the actions changed to *Edit*, *Delete*, *Copy*, and *Add*.

**`sap.m.Label`**

**`sap.m.Label`** has the following new properties:

-   `wrapping`: Determines whether text within a label is wrapped. The default value is `false`. If set to `false`, the label text only uses one line and any exceeding text is truncated and replaced with an ellipsis. When you use the `Label` within a `sap.m.Form` the label text is automatically displayed as wrapped.

    ![](images/loioa18049e61af44b0d9f766dc0d743ea0b_LowRes.png)

-   `displayOnly`: Determines whether the label is in `displayOnly` mode. Controls in this mode are non-interactive, non-focusable, cannot be edited, and do not form part of the tab chain. The `displayOnly` property is used in `Form` controls when they are in preview mode.

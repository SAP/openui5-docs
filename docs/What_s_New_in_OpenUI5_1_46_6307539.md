<td valign="top">

**Support for Persian Calendar**

All our controls now support the Persian calendar. The Persian calendar is also sometimes referred to as "Solar Hijri", "Iranian" or "Farsi" calendar.

The Persian calendar year begins around March 21st of each Gregorian year and ends at around March 20th of the following year. To convert the Persian calendar years into the equivalent Gregorian year, add 621 or 622 years to the Persian calendar year depending on whether the Persian calendar year has begun or not.

**`sap.f.Avatar`**

**`sap.f.Avatar`** is an SAP Fiori 2.0 image-like control that has different display options for representing images, initials, and icons. It allows the usage of different content, shapes, and sizes depending on the use case.

![](images/loiob6de75d7ec6745ef9bd006c430325948_LowRes.png)

There are several predefined sizes, as well as an option to set a custom size.

**`sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`**

This control represents the new SAP Fiori 2.0 base layout for an app. It implements the master-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to three pages in separate columns. The columns are referred to as `Begin`, `Mid`, and `End`, and their width is variable depending on the current layout.

There are several possible layouts that can be changed with the control's API, and also by the user with navigation arrows.

**`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`**

This new SAP Fiori 2.0 control represents an enhanced `sap.f.DynamicPage` that contains controls with semantic-specific meaning. You can set different actions using the available aggregations, and the `sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage` will automatically position them in dedicated sections of the title or the footer of the page, facilitating the implementation of the SAP Fiori 2.0 design guidelines.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model now supports the following features:

-   Changing query options on `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding`

-   Requesting `$count` system query option on `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding`

-   Accessing value lists

-   Forwarding the `$search` system query option

-   Branching from OData V4 model into metadata using the hash \(`#`\) character \(see [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/methods/createBindingContext)\) in `template:with`


> ### Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to Bug Fix**
> 
> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. Due to the bug, however, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with OpenUI5 version 1.44.6.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of OpenUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]` any longer.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

The new `Actions` `scope` property was added to provide an editing option for the `GenericTile` control when included on a Web page, for example, on the SAP Fiori launchpad. It is aligned explicitly with the interaction design of the SAP Fiori launchpad’s *Edit* mode. Both the `sap.m.GenericTile` and `sap.m.SlideTile` controls have been extended with this feature. You use the new `scope` property to switch the visual representation of the `GenericTile` or `SlideTile` on a Web page from the `Display` scope to the `Actions` scope. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.GenericTile) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.GenericTile/sample/sap.m.sample.GenericTileLineMode).

**Demo Kit Improvements**

-   You can now switch the *Samples* to the new *High Contrast White* theme from the *Settings* menu.

-   We reworked the landing page for the *Demo Apps* in the Demo Kit. It now features and highlights demo apps in multiple categories, and tests and related documentation chapters are now linked. Check it out at [Demo Apps](https://sdk.openui5.orgdemoapps).

-   New and reworked demo apps:

    -   *Browse Orders*: A new master-detail app with features for browsing orders

    -   *Shop Administrator*: The tool page demo app has been completely renovated and now showcases a shop administration scenario with controls from the `sap.tnt`, `sap.ui.layout`, and `sap.suite.ui` library.

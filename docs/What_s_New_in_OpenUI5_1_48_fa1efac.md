**Third-Party Library Upgrades**

-   The `Handlebars.js` library has been upgraded from version 3.0.3 to 4.0.5. If you access the parent contexts in your Handlebars templates, make sure that you pass the `compat` flag when compiling:

    ```
    Handlebars.compile(source, {
    	compat: true
    });
    
    ```

    This change has also been applied to the OpenUI5 versions that are still in maintenance \(1.28, 1.38., 1.44\).

-   **QUnit** version 2.3.2 has been added \(module `sap.ui.thirdparty.qunit-2`, resources `sap/ui/thirdparty/qunit-2.js`\).

**Support Assistant and Other Support Tools**

The new Support Assistant tool enables application developers to check whether they have built their applications in accordance with the best practices for building OpenUI5 apps. The tool uses a set of predefined rules to check all aspects of an application, for example, accessibility, performance, data-binding, and more. Support Assistant is integrated into One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\) and can be used as part of OPA tests.

The main features of the tool are:

-   Creation and management of support rules

-   Application analysis

-   Results reporting

For more information, see [Support Assistant](Support_Assistant_57ccd7d.md).

We have also redesigned the other support tools, *Technical Information Dialog* and *Diagnostics*, reworked the [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting_615d9e4.md) documentation section under *Essentials*, and created a [Troubleshooting Tutorial](Troubleshooting_Tutorial_5661952.md) tutorial.

**Reuse Components** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Reuse Components**

You now declare reuse components in the descriptor for applications \(`manifest.json`\). A new factory function has been introduced for creating reuse component instances within the context of the current component. You can extend apps easily on the component level by replacing the usage of a reuse component with a variant that modifies the `manifest.json` values for the reuse component.

You don't have to migrate old applications to the new logic to keep them working. But if you want to benefit from further improvements with regards to component loading and performance, as well as component extensibility \(replace reuse component\), you should consider updating the component usage accordingly.

For more information, see [Using and Nesting Components](Using_and_Nesting_Components_346599f.md) and [Descriptor for Applications, Components, and Libraries \(manifest.json\)](Descriptor_for_Applications_Components_and_Libraries_manifest_json_be0cf40.md).

**Theme Parameter Tool**

There is a new theme parameter tool for finding the best-fitting semantic LESS parameter for a new control. With this tool you can easily search, filter, and preview theme parameters.

With the tool, you can also preview all supported SAP themes and find information about the semantic parameter structure.

`sap.m.MessageView` also allows grouping of messages by setting the property `groupItems` and defining a `groupName` for each item.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Automatic determination of `$select` and `$expand` parameters for OData V4 requests by setting `autoExpandSelect` in the model settings to `true`.

-   Automatic loading of "cross-service references" \(a service that references metadata from other documents\) by the OData V4 model when metadata from the referenced document is needed.

-   Support of the V4-specific `lambda` operators `any` and `all` on collections with new filter operators `FilterOperator.All` and `FilterOperator.Any` and it is possible to create entities on relative bindings


> ### Caution:  
> **Incompatibility Due to Bug Fix**
> 
> The following bug has been reported: If you call the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#getObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/getObject) or the [sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context\#requestObject\(\)](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context/methods/requestObject) methods without a parameter, the expected and documented behavior is that the same result is returned as if the parameter `sPath=""` had been specified. Due to the bug, however, the return value wraps the expected output that can then only be accessed via `.value[0]`, for example `oContext.getObject().value[0]`.
> 
> **If you have used this workaround, your application will break starting with OpenUI5 version 1.44.6.**
> 
> **Solution**: If your application needs to run with both the fixed and unfixed versions of OpenUI5, specify the `sPath=""` parameter, for `sPath` parameter. In both cases, you **must not** use the workaround with `.value[0]`.

> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

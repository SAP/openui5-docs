Your place to contribute to the OpenUI5 documentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the official OpenUI5 documentation from the OpenUI5 Demo Kit as markdown files. You have the chance to comment on and contribute to the documentation to improve it for the OpenUI5 community.

>**Please note**: This repository reflects the current development status of the OpenUI5 documentation, it is not identical to the content of the [OpenUI5 Demo Kit](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic).

## How Does It Work?

1. A daily job fills the `docs` folder of this repository from our content management system.

2. You can view the content in two ways:

   * **[OpenUI5 Markdown Documentation](docs/index.md) (raw)**

     The `docs` folder contains an enriched markdown export of the official OpenUI5 documentation from the [OpenUI5 Demo Kit](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic). This is already quite usable to browse the documentation and find topics you want to improve.

   * **[OpenUI5 Markdown Documentation](https://sap.github.io/openui5-docs/) (docsify)**

     This is a shinier version of the markdown documentation with better search options powered by [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) - Made with ❤️. The contents of the raw version and the docsified version are the same.

3. You can make suggestions and improve the content. Please check our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

4. Our documentation team will review your contributions. Accepted changes will be visible in the [OpenUI5 Nightly Demo Kit](https://openui5nightly.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic) shortly after we have implemented them. With the next OpenUI5 release, these changes will also become part of the official [OpenUI5 documentation in the Demo Kit](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic).

**Demo Kit Feedback**

Thank you all for using the Demo Kit feedback function! We have received many comments and suggestions about the different Demo Kit functionalities and we are considering all of them. Please continue providing your valuable feedback, and we will continue to implement it.

We have improved the following Demo Kit areas:

-   You can now choose to view the whole Demo Kit app in dark or light mode. We have added an *Appearance* setting in the *More Information* menu. If you choose Auto, the mode is based on your OS settings.

-   We have improved the readability of the *Known direct subclasses* popover in the *API Reference*. The subclasses are displayed in a list with only one item per row. It is now easier to browse through the numerous subclasses of base controls, such as `sap.ui.core.Control`.Check it out in the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.core.Control).

-   You can now use the new [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [F\]  shortcut combination to directly enable the global search functionality and start typing without the need to select the search field.

-   We have improved the appearance of long API names, such as methods and aggregations, in the *API Reference* so that they are no longer truncated.

**`sap.f.IllustratedMessage` \(Experimental\)**

Empty states are moments in the user experience where there’s no data to display. Success states are occasions to celebrate and reward a user’s special accomplishment or the completion of an important task. The new `IllustratedMessage` control is the recommended combination of a solution-oriented message, an engaging illustration, and conversational tone to better communicate empty or success states.

**OpenUI5 Models**

The new version of OpenUI5 introduces a new `sap.ui.model.Binding#getResolvedPath` method, which provides the resolved path for a binding's path and context. The method can be used with all bindings. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.Binding/methods/getResolvedPath).

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

If you use a list binding for an OData V4 model and have specified a list of groupable properties in the `groupLevels` array of the `$$aggregation` list binding parameter, you can now use the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#getDownloadUrl` method to obtain the URL for the leaf level data.

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   To improve the loading performance of Integration cards, we have added a new `Auto` value to the `dataMode` \(experimental\) property. It sets the card to start the manifest processing only when the card is in the viewport. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card/sample/sap.ui.integration.sample.LazyLoading) and the [Integrate](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/integrate/api) section in the Card Explorer.
-   In Calendar card, using the new `actions` \(experimental\) property, you can now define an action for each calendar item. A possible use case is when you want to provide a link for an online event or application. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/calendar/calendar) and the [Calendar Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/calendar) section in the Card Explorer.

-   Actions can now also be used as column entries in the Table card and as group entries in the Object card. For more information, see the [Table Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/table) and the [Object Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/object) sections in the Card Explorer

If not explicitly set, the default maximal precision is decided based on the number of digits after the decimal point.

## Support Assistant

The Support Assistant enables developers to check whether their apps are built according to the OpenUI5 best practices and guidelines.

***

### Goals

The tool aims to reduce maintenance and consulting times and to streamline OpenUI5 app development. It uses a set of predefined rules to check all aspects of an application, for example, accessibility, performance, data binding, usability. With a simple click, you can check the current state of your app. After execution, you can analyze the results and apply corrective measures based on the outcome.

Check out the Support Assistant highlights video for an overview of its main functionalities:

### Getting Started

The Support Assistant can be started using a URL or a Technical Information Dialog.

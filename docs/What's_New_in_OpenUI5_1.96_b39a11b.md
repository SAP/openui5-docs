### New Features

**Enabling Apps to Comply with a Content Security Policy \(CSP\) without `eval()` and Inline Styles**

The OpenUI5 framework now allows you to run applications in environments with stricter CSPs. Large parts of OpenUI5 don't require `eval()` or similar functions, as well as inline styles, any longer. For details about the supported policies as well as recommendations on writing CSP-compliant applications, see [Content Security Policy](Content_Security_Policy_fe1a6db.md).

> ### Note:  
> To run in a CSP-enabled environment, your apps need to be prepared for the policy used. See [Content Security Policy](Content_Security_Policy_fe1a6db.md).

**New Theme Available for SAP Fiori User Experience \(Experimental\)**

We have introduced a new theme, the preview version of the *Horizon* visual theme for SAP Fiori \(theme ID: `sap_horizon`\), as an addition to the existing themes. To preview the new theme, see [https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/?sap-ui-theme=sap\_horizon\#/controls](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/?sap-ui-theme=sap_horizon#/controls).

> ### Note:  
> The theme has the status 'experimental' and is thus subject to change. It must not be used as a basis for custom themes as long as the status is 'experimental'.

### Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 Models**

We have provided the new `sap.ui.model.ListBinding#getFilters` method. It is available in all list bindings inheriting from `sap.ui.model.ListBinding`, for example in `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding`. We also provide getters for `sap.ui.model.Filter`.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

We have introduced the new `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#created` method. For created records, the method returns a promise that resolves when the record is created in the back end. The promise is rejected if the record is deleted before being persisted in the back end.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now specify `$select` in addition to the `$$inheritExpandSelect` binding parameter of an [operation binding](OData_Operations_b54f789.md).

-   We have complemented the [OData V4 tutorial](OData_V4_bcdbde6.md) with additional chapters showing how to reuse data in a list-detail scenario.

-   You can now use [`Common.ValueListWithFixedValues`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L672:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListWithFixedValues,-%22) in combination with [`Common.ValueListRelevantQualifiers`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.xml#L666:~:text=%3CTerm%20Name=%22-,ValueListRelevantQualifiers,-%22) if only one value list qualifier is relevant at a time. The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataMetaModel#requestValueListInfo` method returns the relevant value list for the `""` qualifier and provides the original qualifier as the `$qualifier` property of the value list mapping.

### Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.MaskInput`**

We have introduced the `showClearIcon` property. If set to `true`, when there is text input it shows an additional icon that allows users to clear their input. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.m.MaskInput).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.MultiComboBox`**

We have implemented a checkbox that allows users to select all options, placed on top of the suggestions pop-up in the `sap.m.MultiComboBox` control. You can enable it using the `showSelectAll` property. The checkbox gives users the possibility to easily select/deselect all options, also when filtering them. For more information, see the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.m.MultiComboBox/sample/sap.m.sample.MultiComboBoxSelectAll). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   The List and Table cards now allow their content items to be grouped. You can use the new `group` manifest extension to configure the titles of the groups and the order of the items in these groups. For more information, see the [List Card](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/grouping) in the Card Explorer.

-   List cards now support attributes on an item level. They can show up to six attributes of their itemsâ€™ attributes, which are displayed in one or two columns. For more information, see the [List Card](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/types/list) section and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/list/attributes) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have added a new `configurationChange` event, which is fired when some configuration settings are changed as a result of user interaction \(for example - filter change\). For more information, see the [Integration Cards API](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/integrate/api) section and the [Sample](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/configurationChanges) in the Card Explorer.

-   We have introduced a new `sideIndicatorsAlignment` property to the `sap.f.cards.NumericHeader`. This property controls the alignment of the side indicators in the numeric header. It can have two values `Begin` \(default\) or `End`. For more information, see the [Numeric Header](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/headers/numeric) section in the Card Explorer.

# Step 7: JSON Model

Now that we have set up the view and controller, it's about time to think about the M in MVC.

We will add an input field to our app, bind its value to the model, and bind the same value to the description of the input field. The description will be directly updated as the user types.

## webapp/controller/App.controller.js

```js
sap.ui.define([
   "sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller",
   "sap/m/MessageToast",
   "sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel"
], (Controller, MessageToast, JSONModel) => {
   "use strict";

   return Controller.extend("ui5.walkthrough.controller.App", {
      onInit() {
         // set data model on view
         const oData = {
            recipient : {
               name : "World"
            }
         };
         const oModel = new JSONModel(oData);
         this.getView().setModel(oModel);
      },

      onShowHello() {
         MessageToast.show("Hello World");
      }
   });
});
```

We add an `onInit` function to the controller. This is one of OpenUI5's lifecycle methods that is invoked by the framework when the controller is created, similar to the constructor of a control.

Inside the function we instantiate a JSON model. The data for the model only contains a single property for the "recipient", and inside this it also contains one additional property for the name.

To be able to use this model from within the XML view, we call the `setModel` function on the view and pass on our newly created model. The model is now set on the view.

The message toast is just showing the static "Hello World" message. We will show how to load a translated text here in the next step.



## webapp/view/App.view.xml

```xml
<mvc:View
   controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.App"
   xmlns="sap.m"
   xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc">
   <Button
      text="Say Hello"
      press=".onShowHello"/>
   <Input
      value="{/recipient/name}"
      description="Hello {/recipient/name}"
      valueLiveUpdate="true"
      width="60%"/>
</mvc:View>
```

We add an `sap/m/Input` control to the view. With this, the user can enter a recipient for the greetings. We bind its value to a OpenUI5 model by using the declarative binding syntax for XML views:

-   The curly brackets `{â€¦}` indicate that data is taken from the value of the `recipient`'s object name property. This is called "data binding".

-   `/recipient/name` declares the path in the model.

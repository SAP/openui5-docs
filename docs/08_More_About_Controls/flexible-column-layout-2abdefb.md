# Flexible Column Layout

The `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` control implements the list-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to 3 pages in separate columns.

The control is suitable for apps that need to display several logical levels of related information side by side, for example, a list of items, item, sub-item. It is flexible in a sense that the app can focus the user's attention on one particular column by making it larger or even fullscreen.

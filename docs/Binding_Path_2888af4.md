## Binding Path

Binding paths address the different properties and lists in a model and define how a node in the hierarchical data tree can be found.

A binding path consists of a number of name tokens, which are separated by a separator char. In all models provided by the framework, the separator char is the slash "/".

A binding path can either be absolute or relative: Absolute binding paths start with a slash, relative binding paths start with a name token and are resolved relative to the context of the control that is bound. A context exists either for each entry of the aggregation in case of aggregation binding or can be set explicitly for a control by using the `setBindingContext` method.

When you use multiple models, specify the model name within the binding path to address the correct model. The same applies for setting a binding context for such a model. The binding path must start with the model name followed by a '\>' as shown in the following example for setting a binding context.

``` js
oControl.setBindingContext(oContext );
oControl.setBindingContext(oContext,"myModelName");
```

Binding path examples:

```
'/Products/0/ProductName'
'/Products(0)/ProductName'
'ProductName'

//with model name
'myModelName>/Products/0/ProductName'
'myModelName>/Products(0)/ProductName'
'myModelName>ProductName'
```

## Drag-and-Drop Restrictions

There are some known restrictions when using drag and drop.

When you use drag and drop, the following restrictions apply:

-   The transparency of the dragging ghost element and the cursor during drag-and-drop operations is not configurable.

-   Defining constraints for the drag position is not possible.

-   Texts in draggable controls cannot be selected. The text of input fields in draggable controls can be selected, but not dragged.


Note that drag and drop is not accessible. Applications must provide an alternative for users with special needs for drag-and-drop operations.

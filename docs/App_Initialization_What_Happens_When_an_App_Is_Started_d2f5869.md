## App Initialization: What Happens When an App Is Started?

When a user starts an app \(in the SAP Fiori launchpad \(FLP\) or using an HTML page\), several steps will be performed in the background.

***

> ### Note:  
> When a user closes the app, the `destroy` function of the component is called. All models and the router are destroyed. The router will take care of destroying the views.
> 
> If a controller has created resources that need to be destroyed explicitly, for example non-aggregated controls, the app developer has to use the `onExit` function of the controller to free up resources. For more information, see [Controller](Controller_121b8e6.md).

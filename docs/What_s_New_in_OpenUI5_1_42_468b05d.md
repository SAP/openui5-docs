**`sap.f.DynamicPage`**

This control is an SAP Fiori 2.0 control, designed to support the basic SAP Fiori 2.0 floorplans. You can use this control as a basic layout for an app. It consists of a title, a header, content area, and a floating footer. It offers dynamic behavior when scrolling, where part of the header snaps to the title. It offers additional capabilities, such as expanding or snapping the header when clicking on the title, pinning or unpinning the header so that it always stays expanded, and more.

  
  
**Expanded Mode**

**Collapsed Mode**

There is an option for displaying a footer as a toolbar with additional actions. The footer is also known as a “floating footer”, as it appears to float above the content of the page. The benefit of the new footer look-and-feel is that it is easily recognized by the end user.

**Acceleration of OpenUI5 Cloud Deployment**

We now deploy new versions of OpenUI5 earlier to `https://sdk.openui5.org/`. As soon as a new minor version is released, it will also be available there. Check the version overview at [https://sdk.openui5.org/versionoverview.html](https://sdk.openui5.org/versionoverview.html). To access a specific version, add the version number to the URL, for example, `https://sdk.openui5.org/1.40.11/`.

-   The enumeration `CarouselArrowsPlacement` determines where the arrows will be placed \(on the sides of the content or on the sides of the page indicator\).

-   The page indicator now shows numbers instead of bullets, when the number of items in the `Carousel` is above nine.

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Behavior-Driven Development with Gherkin**

OpenUI5 now supports behavior-driven development \(BDD\) with Gherkin. Gherkin allows you to write feature files that get translated into executable regression tests. So you can keep your documentation and specification in sync with the actual implementation in your application. It integrates seamlessly with OPA5 and you can completely reuse your OPA and page objects. You only need to translate an OPA journey to a feature file. For more information, see [Behavior-driven Development with Gherkin](Behavior_driven_Development_with_Gherkin_45ac9f1.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.test.gherkin), and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.test.gherkin).

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Deleting entries

-   Loading annotation files


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing although you might expect these parts as given. While we aimed at being compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(like tree binding\). The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\)** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**One Page Acceptance Tests \(OPA5\)**

-   `waitFor` statements in actions and automatic waiting: When writing custom actions you can now add `waitFor` statements inside the `action` and they will be executed before the `success` callback. This allows you to have complex reuse actions that interact with multiple controls.

    There is a new entry `autoWait` in the `sap.ui.test.Opa.config`.

    ```
    Opa5.extendConfig({
            autoWait: true
        });
    
    ```

    If it is set to `true`, every `waitFor` statement will execute extra checks before executing an `action` or `success` to see if the UI is in a stable state. For example, there is automatic waiting for `XMLHttpRequests` \(request to your server\). OPA will not continue before those requests are done. It also works with a mock server that has a delay. For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.test.Opa5.waitFor`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.test.Opa5/methods/waitFor).

-   New matcher `sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText`: The `I18NText` matcher checks if a control property has the same value as a text from an i18n file. It also checks that the key is in the property file. This allows you to catch all your typos and make your tests independent from the browsers language. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.test.matchers.I18NText).

-   Improved troubleshooting: When OPA encounters a timeout, it collects the most recent logs logged under the `sap.ui.test` namespace and puts it in the test's failure message. All parameters of the `waitFor` method are now validated up front to immediately cause the test to fail if there is a typo.

-   Slowing down the execution: You can now use the new URL parameter `paExecutionDelay` to pass on `myOpaTest.qunit.html?opaExecutionDelay=700` to every OPA test. This means there will be a pause for 700 milliseconds before a new `waitFor` statement is executed. It helps when troubleshooting or if you want to watch OPA clicking through your application because it might be too fast to follow. There is also a dropdown list with three predefined values in your QUnit site.

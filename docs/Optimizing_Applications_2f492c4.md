## Optimizing Applications

OpenUI5 supports several means of optimizing the loading time for applications.

-   **[Resource Handling: Modularization and Localization](Resource_Handling_Modularization_and_Localization_91f2b4d.md "The handling of resources in OpenUI5 is divided in a client-side and a
		server-side part. The two parts are complementary and don’t depend on each other.")**  
The handling of resources in OpenUI5 is divided in a client-side and a server-side part. The two parts are complementary and don’t depend on each other.
-   **[Cache Buster for OpenUI5](Cache_Buster_for_OpenUI5_91f0809.md "A cache buster allows OpenUI5 to notify the browser to
		refresh the resources only when the OpenUI5 resources have been
		changed. As long as they are not changed, the resources can always be fetched from the
		browser's cache.")**  
A cache buster allows OpenUI5 to notify the browser to refresh the resources only when the OpenUI5 resources have been changed. As long as they are not changed, the resources can always be fetched from the browser's cache.
-   **[Application Cache Buster](Application_Cache_Buster_ff7aced.md "The application cache buster (short AppCacheBuster) is similar to the cache buster but is used for application
		resources.")**  
The application cache buster \(short `AppCacheBuster`\) is similar to the cache buster but is used for application resources.

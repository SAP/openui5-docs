## Step 4: Diagnostics Window

In this tutorial step, we have a closer look at the Diagnostics window. It offers a wealth of information including comprehensive technical information, a control tree, and debugging features.

### Opening the Example App and the Diagnostics Window

1.  Download the example app with errors from the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01/preview) and run the app.

2.  Open the *Diagnostics* window by pressing  [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [Alt\] + [S\] .

### Improving App Performance

Let's say that you are facing a performance issue in your app, so let's check some performance-relevant settings in the *Diagnostics* window:

1.  Expand the *Technical Information* section and scroll down to view the loaded libraries.

2.  If you spot any libraries that you originally defined, but you don't actually use, remove them from the `manifest.json` file in your development environment to prevent them from loading. In this case, you can see that the example app loads the `sap.ui.layout` library, even though the `layout` control is not used.

3.  Scroll to the *Configuration \(bootstrap\)* section. You see that the `preload` method is set to synchronous processing.
4.  To improve performance, set the bootstrap parameter `data-sap-ui-async` to `true` in the `index.html` file.

    ``` html
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html>
    <head>
    	<meta charset="utf-8">
    	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    	<title>Heap Of Shards</title>
    
    	<!-- set data-sap-ui-async="true" to enable the user to fix it in the
    	troubleshooting tutorial step 4: Diagnostics Window -->
    	<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
    		src="https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
    		data-sap-ui-theme="sap_belize"
    		data-sap-ui-libs="sap.f"
    		data-sap-ui-resourceroots='{
    			"sap.ui.demo.HeapOfShards": "./",
    			"sap.ui.demo.DoesNotExist": "./DoesNotExist"
    		}'
    		data-sap-ui-oninit="module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport"
    		data-sap-ui-compatVersion="edge"
    		**data-sap-ui-async="true"\>**
    	</script>
    [â€¦]
    ```

### Simulating UI Changes

The app contains a *Do Something* button and you want to make the button bigger. The control tree allows you to test which width is the best.

1.  Expand the *Control Tree* section. Make sure that you display both the app and the *Diagnostics* windows side-by-side or on different monitors. Otherwise the diagnostics window will go to the background.

2.  Press and hold the  [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [Alt\]  keys and click the *Do Something* button in the app. You see the button blinking green.

3.  In the control tree of the *Diagnostics* window, the button is selected and you can see its properties on the right.

4.  Change the value of the `width` property to `100%` and confirm with [Enter\].

    The button width is automatically increased.

5.  The changes that you make in the *Diagnostics* window are only temporary. To make your change permanent, you have to change the app code.

### Trying Different OpenUI5 Versions

If you find a bug in your application, you can easily check whether it has already been fixed in a newer OpenUI5 version. Just try the app with a different OpenUI5 version:

1.  Expand the *Technical Information* section and check the loaded version.

2.  Expand the *Debugging* section.

3.  Choose *Other* from the *Boot application with different UI5 version on next reload* dropdown list.

4.  Enter a custom URL, for example `https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/1.46.6/resources/sap-ui-core.js`.

5.  Choose *Activate Reboot URL*, confirm the dialog box, and reload the app.

6.  Reopen the *Diagnostics* window and expand the *Technical Information* section. The loaded OpenUI5 version is now changed.

# Start SAP Web IDE

Initial Steps in SAP Web IDE

> ### Caution:  
> SAP Web IDE is no longer available via SAP Business Technology Platform trial accounts. Any references to SAP Web IDE in this documentation are only relevant for you if you have access to SAP Web IDE through a productive SAP BTP account. Please consider SAP Business Application Studio as an alternative. See [App Development Using SAP Business Application Studio](app-development-using-sap-business-application-studio-6bbad66.md).



1.  Open SAP Web IDE and wait until the initialization has finished.

    When you start it for the first time, you will see a home screen containing more information about SAP Web IDE.

2.  Change to the *Development* perspective by clicking the icon with the code symbol on the left sidebar.

    You now see a folder list with an entry *Workspace* on the left side and an empty code editor on the right side.

3.  Create your project within the *Workspace* folder by choosing *File* \> *New* \> *Folder* from the menu or [Ctrl\] + [Alt\] + [Shift\] + [N\] . Enter, for example, `myProject` as the folder name.

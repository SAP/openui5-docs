## Step 5: One-Way Data Binding

In contrast to the two-way binding behavior shown above, one-way data binding is also possible. Here, data is transported in one direction only: from the model, through the binding instance to the consumer \(usually the property of a control\), but never in the other direction. In this example, we will change the previous example to use one-way data binding. This will illustrate how the flow of data from the user interface back to the model can be switched off if required.

### Coding

You can view and download all files in the Demo Kit at [Data Binding - Step 5](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.databinding.05/preview).

***

### webapp/index.js

``` js
sap.ui.require([
	"sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel",
	"sap/ui/core/mvc/XMLView"*HIGHLIGHT START*,
	"sap/ui/model/BindingMode"*HIGHLIGHT END*
], function (JSONModel, XMLView*HIGHLIGHT START*, BindingMode*HIGHLIGHT END*) {
	"use strict";

	// Attach an anonymous function to the SAPUI5 'init' event
	sap.ui.getCore().attachInit(function () {
		// Create a JSON model from an object literal
		var oModel = new JSONModel({
			firstName: "Harry",
			lastName: "Hawk",
			enabled: true,
			panelHeaderText: "Data Binding Basics"
		});

*HIGHLIGHT START*		oModel.setDefaultBindingMode(BindingMode.OneWay);

*HIGHLIGHT END*
		// Assign the model object to the SAPUI5 core
		sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel);

		// Display the XML view called "App"
		new XMLView({
			viewName: "sap.ui.demo.db.view.App"
		}).placeAt("content");
	});
});

```

Insert the single highlighted line immediately after the creation of the model object in `index.js`.

Now, no matter what state the checkbox is in, the input fields remain open for input because one-way data binding ensures that data flows only from the model to the UI, but never in the other direction.

The binding mode \(one-way or two-way\) is set on the model itself. Therefore, unless you specifically alter it, a binding instance will always be created using the model's default binding mode.

Should you wish to alter the binding mode, then there are two ways of doing this:

-   Alter the model's default binding mode. This is the approach used above.

-   Specify the data binding mode for a specific binding instance by using the `oBindingInfo.mode` parameter. This change applies only to this data binding instance. Any other binding instances will continue to use the model's default binding mode.For more information, see [API Reference: `sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.bindProperty`](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.ui.base.ManagedObject/methods/bindProperty). 


> ### Note:  
> There are two important points to understand about alterations to a model object's data binding mode:
> 
> -   If you alter the default binding mode of a model \(as in the example above\), then unless you explicitly say otherwise, all binding instances created after that point in time will use the altered binding mode.
> 
> -   Altering a model's default binding mode has no effect on already existing binding instances.

We will now change the user interface so that the first and last name fields are displayed using sap.m.Input fields and an additional check box control is used to enable or disable both input fields. This arrangement illustrates a feature known as &quot;two-way data binding&quot;. Now that the view contains more controls, we will also move the view definition into an XML file.")

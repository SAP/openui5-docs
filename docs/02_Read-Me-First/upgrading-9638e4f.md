# Upgrading

The following sections describe what you have to consider when upgrading to a new version of OpenUI5.

Before upgrading to a newer OpenUI5 version, you must generally first ensure that your development strictly follows the documented compatibility guidelines, such as:

-   [Compatibility Rules](compatibility-rules-91f0873.md)
-   [Use Only Public APIs](../03_Get-Started/use-only-public-apis-b0d5fe2.md)
-   [Coding Issues to Avoid](../05_Developing_Apps/coding-issues-to-avoid-3877872.md)
-   [The Owner Component](../04_Essentials/the-owner-component-a7a3138.md)
-   [Don't Use Deprecated or Experimental Features](../03_Get-Started/don-t-use-deprecated-or-experimental-features-a8bd1a8.md)
-   [ECMAScript Support](ecmascript-support-0cb44d7.md)

See also our related guidelines at [Best Practices for Developers](../03_Get-Started/best-practices-for-developers-28fcd55.md).

Afterwards, refer to the following version-specific sections that describe what else you have to consider:

# Mobile Events

In addition to the general browser and control events you can access specific events for touch-enabled devices.

When implementing OpenUI5 controls, some browser events can be handled very easily by implementing a method named `on<eventName>`, so all the bind/unbind effort is avoided. This is equally possible on mobile.

On touch-enabled platforms additional browser and pseudo events are available:

***

<a name="loio9860cd2b183540f48ee054bcef44a8b5__section_N1001C_N10011_N10001"/>

## Additional Mobile Browser Events

On touch-enabled platforms the following events are also provided within UI5 controls to be handled in `on<eventName>` methods:

-   `touchstart` 
-   `touchend` 
-   `touchmove` 
-   `touchcancel` 

***

<a name="loio9860cd2b183540f48ee054bcef44a8b5__section_N1004E_N10011_N10001"/>

## Additional Mobile Pseudo Events

jQuery mobile event handling is used in OpenUI5 when running on touch-enabled devices. From the basic browser events it creates semantically richer events. Some of them are also provided automatically in OpenUI5 controls:

-   `swipe` 
-   `tap` 
-   `swipeleft` 
-   `swiperight` 
-   `scrollstart` 
-   `scrollstop`

## Devices Supporting both Mouse and Touch Input

A number of devices allow user interaction by both mouse and touch input. To be able to react to both kind of events, some additional functionality has been introduced.

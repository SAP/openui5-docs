## High Contrast Themes for OpenUI5 Controls

 OpenUI5 offers two high contrast themes for controls - High Contrast Black \(HCB\) and High Contrast White \(HCW\). These themes support people with visual impairments and are required by the **Accessibility** product standard. The themes can be switched on by adding a dedicated URL parameter.

***

### OpenUI5 library support

Currently, the following libraries support the high contrast themes:

-   `sap.f`

-   `sap.m`

-   `sap.tnt`

-   `sap.ui.layout`

-   `sap.ui.suite`

-   `sap.ui.table`

-   `sap.ui.unified`

-   `sap.uxap`


***

### Switching on the HCB theme

You can switch on the High Contrast Black theme by appending the `sap_fiori_3_hcb` URL parameter as in the following example.

> ### Example:  
> HCB Theme Enablement
> 
> `http://<hostname>:<port>...?<parameter>=<value>&...&**sap\_fiori\_3\_hcb**`

***

### Switching on the HCW theme

You can switch on the High Contrast White theme by appending the `sap_fiori_3_hcw` URL parameter as in the following example.

> ### Example:  
> HCW Theme Enablement
> 
> `http://<hostname>:<port>...?<parameter>=<value>&...&**sap\_fiori\_3\_hcw**`

> ### Note:  
> Have in mind that OpenUI5 is not optimized for the high contrast mode of Windows. You will have to enable the HCB or HCW theme as described above. Occasionally, if you have enabled both the Windows contrast setting and the OpenUI5 high contrast theme, this may cause conflicts and deficiencies in the theme can occur. In such cases, please switch off the Windows setting.

# Accessibility

In this guide we cover the most important accessibility aspects for application development, based on OpenUI5.

As an application developer, you need to be aware of accessibility in every step of the process. OpenUI5 controls have built-in accessibility features, but you need to take care when building and combining them into an application. First check the information in [Accessibility](../04_Essentials/accessibility-322f55d.md) in the Essentials section, if you haven't already.

The following chapters showcase different aspects and offer tips how to test your app.

-   **[Screen Reader Support](screen-reader-support-33fae34.md "OpenUI5 application developers need to be aware
		of how the screen reader reads out the contents of the UI. Labels, headings, and
		descriptions help you describe the contents and visual elements of an application. ")**  
OpenUI5 application developers need to be aware of how the screen reader reads out the contents of the UI. Labels, headings, and descriptions help you describe the contents and visual elements of an application.
-   **[Keyboard Handling](keyboard-handling-e303820.md "Keyboard handling enables users to access every UI element of the application with the
		keyboard and is therefore tightly connected to accessibility. Additionally, this aspect is
		coupled to the screen reader functionality.")**  
Keyboard handling enables users to access every UI element of the application with the keyboard and is therefore tightly connected to accessibility. Additionally, this aspect is coupled to the screen reader functionality.
-   **[Colors and Theming](colors-and-theming-086c41c.md "Theming is an important aspect for an OpenUI5 application. The different colors shown
		on the UI need to have a good contrast to each other in order to be easily
		distinguishable.")**  
Theming is an important aspect for an OpenUI5 application. The different colors shown on the UI need to have a good contrast to each other in order to be easily distinguishable.
-   **[Text Size and Fonts](text-size-and-fonts-a3465c8.md "The size of the text and the font choice greatly impact the visibility and readability
		of an application. Additionally, your application also has to still be usable at high zoom
		levels. ")**  
The size of the text and the font choice greatly impact the visibility and readability of an application. Additionally, your application also has to still be usable at high zoom levels.
-   **[Recommendations](recommendations-ee37fc7.md "When developing OpenUI5 applications, you need to pay attention
		to the correctness of the resulting HTML. Some vital accessibility features (screen reader
		and keyboard support) rely on a correct and meaningful structure of the
		application.")**  
When developing OpenUI5 applications, you need to pay attention to the correctness of the resulting HTML. Some vital accessibility features \(screen reader and keyboard support\) rely on a correct and meaningful structure of the application.

## Step 8: Testing Navigation

 So far, we have a list of posts on the home page of the app. But typically, a post comes with more details that should be displayed on a separate detail page. We call it the post page because it displays details of a post. In this step we will introduce a new journey to test the post page. We write tests that trigger typical navigation events with OPA. Testing navigation greatly helps in reducing manual testing efforts as it covers a lot of testing paths. It is good practice to cover every view of your application with at least one test, since OPA will check if an exception is thrown. In this way you can detect critical errors very fast.

### webapp/test/integration/PostJourney.js \(New\)

``` js
*HIGHLIGHT START*sap.ui.define([
	"sap/ui/test/opaQunit",
	"./pages/Worklist",
	"./pages/Browser",
	"./pages/Post"
], function (opaTest) {
	"use strict";

	QUnit.module("Post");

	opaTest("Should see the post page when a user clicks on an entry of the list", function (Given, When, Then) {
		// Arrangements
		Given.iStartMyApp();

		//Actions
		When.onTheWorklistPage.iPressOnTheItemWithTheID("PostID_15");

		// Assertions

	});

	opaTest("Should go back to the TablePage", function (Given, When, Then) {
		// Actions
		When.onThePostPage.iPressTheBackButton();

		// Assertions
		Then.onTheWorklistPage.iShouldSeeTheTable();
	});

	opaTest("Should be on the post page again when the browser's forward button is pressed", function (Given, When, Then) {
		// Actions
		When.onTheBrowser.iPressOnTheForwardButton();

		// Assertions
		Then.onThePostPage.theTitleShouldDisplayTheName("Jeans");

		// Cleanup
		Then.iTeardownMyApp();
	});
});*HIGHLIGHT END*
```

This new journey for the *Post* page introduces a test case that tests the navigation and also tests if the browser history is in the correct state, so that the user can navigate through our app with the back and forward button of the browser. This time, instead of adding a test we will add a new journey.

A journey represents a user’s task in our app. Journeys start with the startup of our app and end with a teardown in the last test. We don’t write isolated tests here, since starting up the app takes a lot of time and doing it too often slows down our test execution and feedback time considerably. If the execution speed of the tests is no problem, you may also write isolated tests.

Our new journey consists of three user interaction steps:

1.  User chooses a *Post* to view the details

2.  User chooses the *Back* button on the *Detail* page of the *Post* to see the list again

3.  User chooses the *Forward* button to revisit the details of the post

### webapp/test/integration/pages/Worklist.js – action object

``` js
sap.ui.define([
		'sap/ui/test/Opa5',
		'sap/ui/test/matchers/AggregationLengthEquals',
		'sap/ui/test/matchers/I18NText',
		*HIGHLIGHT START*'sap/ui/test/matchers/BindingPath',*HIGHLIGHT END*
		'sap/ui/test/actions/Press'
	],
	function (Opa5,
			  AggregationLengthEquals,
			  I18NText,
*HIGHLIGHT START*			  BindingPath,*HIGHLIGHT END*
			  Press) {
		"use strict";

		var sViewName = "Worklist",
			sTableId = "table";

		Opa5.createPageObjects({
			onTheWorklistPage: {
				actions: {
…
*HIGHLIGHT START*                        ,
					iPressOnTheItemWithTheID: function (sId) {
						return this.waitFor({
							controlType: "sap.m.ColumnListItem",
							viewName: sViewName,
							matchers:  new BindingPath({
								path: "/Posts('" + sId + "')"
							}),
							actions: new Press(),
							errorMessage: "No list item with the id " + sId + " was found."
						});
					}*HIGHLIGHT END*
```

Now that we have written our spec how the navigation to the *Post* page is planned, we first need to implement the "click" on a list item. To identify the item we are looking for, we use the `BindingPath` matcher. Doing so, we make sure that even if the order of the items changes, we always choose the same item. The `press` action simulates a user click on the item.

### **webapp/test/integration/pages/Post.js \(New\)**

``` js
*HIGHLIGHT START*sap.ui.define([
	'sap/ui/test/Opa5',
	'sap/ui/test/matchers/Properties',
	'sap/ui/test/actions/Press'
], function (Opa5, Properties, Press) {
		"use strict";
		var sViewName = "Post";
		Opa5.createPageObjects({
			onThePostPage: {
				actions: {
					iPressTheBackButton: function () {
						return this.waitFor({
							id: "page",
							viewName: sViewName,
							actions: new Press(),
							errorMessage: "Did not find the nav button on object page"
						});
					}
				},
				assertions: {
					theTitleShouldDisplayTheName: function (sName) {
						return this.waitFor({
							success: function () {
								return this.waitFor({
									id: "objectHeader",
									viewName: sViewName,
									matchers: new Properties({
										title: sName
									}),
									success: function (oPage) {
										Opa5.assert.ok(true, "was on the remembered detail page");
									},
									errorMessage: "The Post " + sName + " is not shown"
								});
							}
						});
					}
				}
			}
		});
	});
*HIGHLIGHT END*
```

After navigating to the *Post* page, we need a new OPA5 `Page` object for the page to implement our actions and assertions.

An OPA5 `Page` object is used to group and reuse actions and assertions that are related to a specific part of the screen. For more information, see [Cookbook for OPA5](Cookbook_for_OPA5_ce4b180.md).

We implement a `press` event on the page’s `nav` button and we assert that we are on the correct page by checking the title in the object header. The `nav` button is retrieved via DOM reference, because the page does not offer us an API here. Since the DOM ID is the most stable attribute, we are using this to retrieve the button.

***

### **webapp/test/integration/pages/Worklist.js – assertion object**

``` js
…
*HIGHLIGHT START*,
					iShouldSeeTheTable: function () {
						return this.waitFor({
							id: sTableId,
							viewName: sViewName,
							success: function () {
								Opa5.assert.ok(true, "The table is visible");
							},
							errorMessage: "Was not able to see the table."
						});
					}*HIGHLIGHT END*
…
```

After going back, we want to move forwards again, but we need to check if the back navigation actually took place. So we assert that we are back on our table of posts again. We achieve this with a very simple `waitFor` statement just checking if the table is present.

***

### **webapp/test/integration/pages/Browser.js \(New\)**

``` js
*HIGHLIGHT START*sap.ui.define([
	'sap/ui/test/Opa5'
], function (Opa5) {
	"use strict";
		Opa5.createPageObjects({
			onTheBrowser: {
				actions: {
					iPressOnTheForwardButton: function () {
						return this.waitFor({
							success: function () {
								Opa5.getWindow().history.forward();
							}
						});
					}
				},
				assertions: {}
			}
		});
	}); *HIGHLIGHT END*
```

We now implement an action that is triggered when the *Forward* button is chosen. Since it is not part of the browser's UI and it could be used on any page of our application, we just declare our browser’s UI as an own OPA page object. To simulate the *Forward* button, we use the `history` API of the browser. We have to wrap our action in a `waitFor` statement. Otherwise the action would be executed before our app is started.

***

### **webapp/test/integration/AllJourneys.js**

``` js
sap.ui.define([
	"sap/ui/test/Opa5",
	"./arrangements/Startup",
	"./WorklistJourney",
	*HIGHLIGHT START*"./PostJourney"*HIGHLIGHT END*
], function (Opa5, Startup) {
	"use strict";

	Opa5.extendConfig({
		arrangements: new Startup(),
		viewNamespace: "sap.ui.demo.bulletinboard.view.",
		autoWait: true
	});
});
```

To make navigation tests complete, we add the new journey to the `AllJourneys` file that is invoked by the OPA test page.

If you execute the tests now, you can see in the logs of the developer tools that OPA is waiting for the object page to be displayed. Of course, this will not happen as it is not yet implemented. But we already have a pretty good idea on how we will implement the feature in the next step

**Parent topic:** [Testing](Testing_291c912.md "In this tutorial we will test application functionality with the testing tools that are delivered with OpenUI5. At different steps of this tutorial you will write tests using QUnit, OPA5, and the OData V2 mock server. Additionally, you will learn about testing strategies, Test Driven Development (TDD), and much more.")

**Next:** [Step 7: Changing the Table to a Growing Table](Step_7_Changing_the_Table_to_a_Growing_Table_016e0d4.md "Let’s switch back to developing and add the missing feature for the test we implemented in the previous step. We will simply change the table to a growing table as this is a basic feature of the table. This will display a trigger at the end of the table that the user can click on to display more items.")

**Previous:** [Step 9: Adding the Post Page](Step_9_Adding_the_Post_Page_4a9f063.md "Now that we have covered all kinds of tests for navigation, we introduce our Post page that shows details of a post in the bulletin board. To achieve this, we have to introduce a new view/controller pair and adjust the routing of the application.")

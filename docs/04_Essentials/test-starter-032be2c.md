# Test Starter

The test starter is a concept intended to simplify the test setup for OpenUI5 applications and libraries by orchestrating your QUnit and OPA5 tests.

## Goals

Using the test starter concept in your project:

-   reduces the boiler plate code needed to write a QUnit test;
-   ensures the loading of the most commonly used testing frameworks \(for example, QUnit, Sinon.JS, qunit-reporter\);
-   ensures these testing frameworks and your test modules are loaded completely asynchronously and comply with the [Content Security Policy](../05_Developing_Apps/content-security-policy-fe1a6db.md);
-   allows moving the configuration of the testing frameworks out of the test code.

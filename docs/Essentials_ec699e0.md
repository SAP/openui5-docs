### OpenUI5 Architecture

 ![OpenUI5 Architecture Overview](loio99b4be76a3f94db18172e67e730fb7fb_LowRes.png) 

OpenUI5 is a client UI technology based on JavaScript, CSS and HTML5.

Apps developed with OpenUI5 run in a browser on any device \(mobile, tablet or desktop PC\).

When users access an OpenUI5 app, a request is sent to the respective server to load the application into the browser. The view accesses the relevant libraries. Usually the model is also instantiated and business data is fetched from the database.

Depending on the environment in which OpenUI5 is used, the libraries or your applications can be stored, for example, on an SAP NetWeaver Application Server or an SAP Business Technology Platform, and business data can be accessed, for example, using the OData model through a SAP Gateway.

### Artifacts in the Framework

The top-level structural unit is called a **library**. Libraries are the master artifacts in the extensibility concept. They bundle a set of controls and related types and make them consumable by Web applications. There are predefined and standard libraries, like `sap.m`, with many commonly used controls. At the same time, it treats custom UI libraries as first-class citizens, making it easy for you to write and use your own controls alongside the predefined ones.

A UI **element** is the basic building block of our user interfaces; it is a reusable entity with properties, events, methods, and relations. The most important relations are aggregations to other UI elements, and in this way a tree structure of elements can be created.

From a developer's point of view, a **control** \(e.g. `Button`, `Label`, `TextField`, or `Table`\) is the most important artifact. It is an object which controls the appearance and user interaction of a rectangular screen region. It is a special kind of user interface element which can be used as the root of such a tree structure. In this way, it serves as an entry point, especially for rendering. Besides controls, there are also other **non-control elements**, which cannot be used as the root of such a tree structure, but only as a dependent part within it \(e.g. `TableRow`, `TableCell`\).

**Data types** are first-class entities in the meta model. This allows reuse of types across libraries and extensibility of the type system. The core library \(technically, this is the `sap.ui.core` library\) already defines a core set of types that can be used in other libraries.

		in your HTML page, you have to load and initialize the SAPUI5 library.")**

-   **[Structuring: Components and Descriptor](Structuring_Components_and_Descriptor_dc9e11c.md "OpenUI5 provides Components as independent and reusable parts of UI5
		applications. They facilitate the encapsulation of closely related parts of an application, thus enabling developers to structure and maintain
		their applications more easily.")**  
OpenUI5 provides Components as independent and reusable parts of UI5 applications. They facilitate the encapsulation of closely related parts of an application, thus enabling developers to structure and maintain their applications more easily.
-   **[Model View Controller \(MVC\)](Model_View_Controller_MVC_91f2334.md "The Model View Controller (MVC) concept is used in OpenUI5 to separate the
		representation of information from the user interaction. This separation facilitates development and the changing of parts independently.")**  
The Model View Controller \(MVC\) concept is used in OpenUI5 to separate the representation of information from the user interaction. This separation facilitates development and the changing of parts independently.
-   **[Data Binding](Data_Binding_68b9644.md "You use data binding to bind UI elements to data sources to keep the data in sync and
		allow data editing on the UI.")**  
You use data binding to bind UI elements to data sources to keep the data in sync and allow data editing on the UI.
-   **[Reusing UI Parts: Fragments](Reusing_UI_Parts_Fragments_36a5b13.md "Fragments are light-weight UI parts (UI sub-trees) which can be reused, defined similar
		to views, but do not have any controller or other behavior code involved.")**  
Fragments are light-weight UI parts \(UI sub-trees\) which can be reused, defined similar to views, but do not have any controller or other behavior code involved.

		source level, the XML DOM, at runtime just before an OpenUI5 control tree is
		created from the XML source.")**  
The XML templating concept enables you to use an XML view as a template. This template is transformed by an XML preprocessor on the source level, the XML DOM, at runtime just before an OpenUI5 control tree is created from the XML source.

-   **[Routing and Navigation](Routing_and_Navigation_3d18f20.md "OpenUI5 offers hash-based
        navigation, which allows you to build single-page apps where the navigation is done by
        changing the hash. In this way the browser does not have to reload the page; instead there
        is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react. A hash string is

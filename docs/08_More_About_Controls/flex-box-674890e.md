# Flex Box

The `sap.m.FlexBox` control allows to develop layouts which adjust to the available space and avoid unused space or overflow.

User interfaces often have to adapt to different screen sizes. Therefore, building user interfaces in a way that a single layout reliably fits the available screen real estate is challenging. `FlexBox` controls can be nested to create more complex layouts.

The two main uses of a FlexBox control are:

-   Two-dimensional layouting
-   Flexible layouts

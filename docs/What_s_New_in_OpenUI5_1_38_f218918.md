**OpenUI5 OData V4 model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 model**

We are providing an initial version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 Model. This model supports the following:

-   Read access

-   Updating properties of OData entities via two-way-binding

-   Operation \(function and action\) execution

-   Grouping data requests in a batch request

-   Server-side sorting and filtering


> ### Restriction:  
> This is the first version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. Due to its limited feature scope, we recommend you do not use this release to develop applications that are to be used in production systems. Please look at the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing which you might expect as given. While our intention was to be compatible with existing controls, existing controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model. Up to now, only limited tests with controls have been done with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed to make usage of the model easier and more efficient. A summary of these changes is documented in the section [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**`sap.m.GenericTile`** 

The `GenericTile` control has a new responsive design that significantly improves the user experience, it has also been optimized for larger smartphones. The `GenericTile` adjusts its size to fit all the different display sizes of the current devices supported by OpenUI5 \(see [Browser and Platform Support](Browser_and_Platform_Support_74b59ef.md)\). The main changes are the tile size, font size, padding, the new `ImageContent` control, and new samples showing the variety of use cases for the `GenericTile`.

The `sap.m.ImageContent` control can be used to include images in a tile. It can be embedded in the content area of the `GenericTile` control.

**`sap.ui.table.TreeTable`**

**`sap.ui.table.TreeTable`** now supports `AutoExpand` paging if it is bound to an OData model.

By setting `numberOfExpandedLevels` as a binding parameter \(e.g. in the `bindRows` call of the `TreeTable`\), you now can specify the initial expansion depth. This feature is only available for OData services exposing a property marked with the annotation `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for`. This also means the service has to respect a `$filter` statement on the annotated `Level` property, and returns the entries sorted. You can find the specification for this and all other hierarchy annotations in the SAP Community Network under [SAP Annotations for OData Version 2.0](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-44986).

**`sap.uxap.ObjectPageHeader`**

`ObjectPageHeader` can be integrated with the `SideContent` scenario. A new `sideContentButton` aggregation has been added. This aggregation has a new button, which appears after the actions buttons and triggers opening the side content for additional information.

**`sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout`**

-   It supports scrolling to a particular section, based on its ID. This allows easier access to all parts of the application and consistent navigation back to a previous position within the `ObjectPage`.

    For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout/sample/sap.uxap.sample.ObjectPageLazyLoadingWithoutBlocks).

-   Performance is improved for the use case with no `Blocks`. The `ObjectPage` now supports lazy loading with the stashed property of the `ObjectPageLazyLoader`. As a result, you avoid the additional creation of XML views for each `Block`.

    For more information, see [Object Page Scrolling](Object_Page_Scrolling_bc410e9.md) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.uxap.ObjectPageLayout/sample/sap.uxap.sample.ObjectPageState).

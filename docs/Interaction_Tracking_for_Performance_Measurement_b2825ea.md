## Interaction Tracking for Performance Measurement

You can analyze the performance of your UI5 application by tracking the interaction that is performed on the UI.

Interaction in this context means a closed step in a sequence of actions that a user performs on the UI, for example, everything that happens between two clicks on two different buttons. The interaction tracking considers XHRs, loadings triggered via script tags and rendering aspects.

To **start** interaction tracking, use `Interaction.setActive(true)` from module `sap/ui/performance/trace/Interaction`. To map the interaction data to the data of `sap/ui/performance/Measurement`, you have to explicitly set `sap-ui-measure=true`.

To **retrieve** the result of the interaction measurement, use `Interaction.getAll()` from module `sap/ui/performance/trace/Interaction`. This returns an array of all interactions that occurred and their measurement.

You can use `Interaction.filter` from module `sap/ui/performance/trace/Interaction` to filter the interaction measurements according to a filter function \(`fnFilter`\).

### Example of an Interaction Measurement

``` js
InteractionMeasurement = {
    id: uid()                   // interaction ID
    event: "click",             // event which triggered interaction - default is startup interaction
    trigger: "Button1",         // element ID
    component: "my.Component",  // component or app identifier
    start : 0,                  // interaction start
    end: 0,                     // interaction end
    navigation: 0,              // sum over all navigation times
    roundtrip: 0,               // time from first request sent to last received response end - without gaps and ignored overlap
    processing: 0,              // client processing time
    duration: 0,                // interaction duration
    requests: [],               // all requests (XHRs) that occured during the interaction
    measurements: [],           // sap/ui/performance/Measurement measurements
    sapStatistics: [],          // SAP Statistics for OData
    requestTime: 0,             // sum over all requests in the interaction
    networkTime: 0,             // request time minus server time from the sap-perf-fesrec header
    bytesSent: 0,               // sum over all requests bytes
    bytesReceived: 0,           // sum over all response bytes
    requestCompression: false,  // true if all responses have been sent gzipped - default is undefined
    busyIndication: 0           // summed BusyIndicator duration during this interaction
}
```

### Opening the Example App and Support Assistant

1.  Download the example app with errors from the Demo Kitat [Troubleshooting](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting/sample/sap.ui.core.tutorial.troubleshooting.01) and run the app.

2.  Activate the Support Assistant using one of the following options:

    -   Open the *Technical Information Dialog* by pressing [Ctrl\] + [Shift\] + [Alt\] + [P\]  and choose *Activate Support Assistant*.

    -   Use the URL parameter: `sap-ui-support=true`.


    The Support Assistant toolbar opens in the footer of the app.

### Analyzing and Fixing Issues

1.  In the *Support Assistant* toolbar, choose *Rules*.

2.  In the *Available Rules* tab, select all rules, and choose *Analyze*.

    You now see a list of issues.

3.  Select *Model: Unresolved binding path* in the list of issues. In the issue details, you see the following message: *Element HeapOfShards---app--LabelWithMissingI18NText with binding path 'Label\_Missing\_I18N\_Text' has the same value as the path. Potential Error.*

4.  Open the `i18n.properties` file in your development environment and add the missing text.

    ```
    [â€¦]
    item1Text=Item 1
    item2Text=Item 2
    selectEventMessage=Event "{0}" fired.
    Label_Missing_I18N_Text=Label Text
    
    ```

    For more information, see [Walkthrough Step 8: Translatable Texts](step-8-translatable-texts-df86bfb.md)

5.  Restart the app and start the analysis again. This issue should now be gone. We have intentionally hidden some more errors in the code - check and see if you can find and correct them.

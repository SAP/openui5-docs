With the new `addGroup` method, you can now easily create custom groups and custom-group headers for those groups. In addition, with the new `setGroupHeader` method, you can change the group header of a custom group. For more information, see the [DynamicDateRange API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.DynamicDateRange/methods/addGroup), and the [DynamicDateRangeGroups enumeration](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.DynamicDateRangeGroups).

The control now displays the row-header images using size S avatars with a circle shape. The UX guidance is to use circle shapes for people \(default for the control\), and squares for other business images. You can easily change the shape using the new `iconShape` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendar).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

We have added documentation and a sample that demonstrate how you can bundle all the necessary files needed for a Component card using the UI5 Tooling. With this card type, card developers can expose a whole UI5 Component as content for the card. For more information, see the [Component Preload](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/bundle/componentPreload) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/component/componentPreload) in the Card Explorer.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   **Experimental:** You can now create and delete nodes in recursive hierarchies. Note that these experimental features must not be used in productive applications yet.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`ODataListBinding#create`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/create) and [`Context#delete`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/delete).

-   We now support the provision of a nested single entity in a transient entity.

    For more information, see *Nested Single Entity* in [Deep Create](Creating_an_Entity_c9723f8.md#loioc9723f8265f644af91c0ed941e114d46__section_DCR).

When a message toast opens, users can now move focus to the message using the following combination: [Ctrl/Command\] + [Shift\] + [M\] .

This allows them to keep the message on the screen for as long as they need.

**Deprecations**

We have deprecated the following entities for `sap.ui.table*`:

-   `grouped` property of `Column`

**`sap.m.Table`, `sap.m.List`, `sap.m.Tree`**

To improve accessibility, we have completely reworked the screen reader support and keyboard handling of the `sap.m.Table` control. The row-based navigation stays the same, but cell-based navigation is now also possible, similar to the grid table. We have also improved other accessibility features of the table, for example, the *Delete* and *Edit* buttons for row actions have become accessible via keyboard. These features have not only been changed for the responsive table, but partly also for `sap.m.List`. Also, the ARIA role has been adapted. .

# Walkthrough Tutorial \(TypeScript\)

In this tutorial we'll introduce you to all major development paradigms of OpenUI5. We'll demonstrate the use of TypeScript with OpenUI5 and highlight the specific characteristics of this approach.

We first introduce you to the basic development paradigms like *Model-View-Controller* and establish a best-practice structure of our application. We'll do this along the classic example of "Hello World" and start a new app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the fundamental data binding concepts of OpenUI5 and extend our app to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive. We'll also have a look at the testing features and the built-in support tools of OpenUI5.

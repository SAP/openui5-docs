## Project Setup

Before you start developing apps with OpenUI5, you start by setting up the development environment of your choice. You can find our recommendations under [Development Environment](development-environment-7bb04e0.md).

## Development

When faced with developing an app, you have several ways to get started ranging from app templates or a make-em-completely-from-scratch approach. But which approach is right for your situation? In most cases, it's your level of expertise or need for flexibility and freedom that will decide.

If you're skilled at coding and want the freedom and flexibility, you can build an app completely from scratch. In the chapters in this section, you will find some guidance on how to deal with crucial concepts such as accessibility, security, device adaptation.

Be sure to check out information about things that you really should avoid doing while coding: [Coding Issues to Avoid](coding-issues-to-avoid-3877872.md).

## Packaging and Deployment

How you deploy your app when you're finished depends on the tools you use and the platform where your app is going to run. See the related documentation for details.

For example, it's quite easy to deploy an app to SAP Business Technology Platform with SAP Business Application Studio. For more information about SAP Business Application Studio, see the documentation on the SAP Help Portal at [SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/Cloud/en-US).

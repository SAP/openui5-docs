## Tools

For the tools used for OpenUI5 content development, guidelines and recommendations have been introduced.

The following guidelines and recommendations apply:

-   To make issues with mixed tabs/spaces and windows-style linebreaks visible immediately, we recommend to configure your JavaScript editor to display whitespace and linebreak characters.

-   We also recommend to configure the code formatter of your code editor accordingly.

-   Do **not** use the auto formatter to format entire files. The auto formatter handles many lines and makes it more difficult to find out who actually wrote the code.

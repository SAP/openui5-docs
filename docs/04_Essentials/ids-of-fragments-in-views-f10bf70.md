# IDs of Fragments in Views

For fragments that are used within declarative views, generated IDs are not prefixed.

The following rules apply for given IDs:

-   Given IDs are prefixed with only the view ID when no fragment ID was given
-   Given IDs are prefixed with both view ID and fragment ID when a fragment ID was given

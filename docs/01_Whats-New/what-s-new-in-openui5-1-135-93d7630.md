**`sap.ui.layout.form*`**

To improve the accessibility of screen reader announcements, we have adapted the rendering of the `sap.ui.layout.form*` elements in forms with read-only content for the `columnLayout`. To enable this, the form is now rendered as a description list \(`<dl>` tag used\).

**Enhanced Module Name Syntax for Factory APIs**

You can now use module name syntax when creating typed views, controllers, or JS fragments via a factory API. This removes the need for strict filename suffixes like `.view.js`, `.controller.js`, or `.fragment.js`, offering you more flexibility in naming and organizing your entities. For an example, see [Controller](../04_Essentials/controller-121b8e6.md).

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We now support read-only bindings for Geometry types. This includes the possibility to address elements of collections via their indexes in read-only bindings.

-   We now evaluate [`com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.AddressViaNavigationPath`](https://github.com/SAP/odata-vocabularies/blob/main/vocabularies/Common.md) for PATCH and DELETE requests.

-   When reloading a list binding's data, the selection state is now validated if the `$$clearSelectionOnFilter` list binding parameter is set and if `$$aggregation` is not set. The selection state of contexts no longer matching the filter is reset.

-   We have introduced the experimental `copy` parameter to `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move`. It must not be set to `true` for productive applications yet.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).

-   We have provided the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#getSelectionCount` method to return the number of selected items. The selection count may be bound by using the `$selectionCount` parameter in a similar way as for binding the `$count`. For more information, see [Binding Collection Inline Count](../04_Essentials/binding-collection-inline-count-77d2310.md).

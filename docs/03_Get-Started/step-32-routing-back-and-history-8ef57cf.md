# Step 32: Routing Back and History

Now we can navigate to our detail page and display an invoice, but we cannot go back to the overview page yet. We'll add a back button to the detail page and implement a function that shows our overview page again.

## webapp/view/Detail.view.xml

```xml
<mvc:View
	controllerName="ui5.walkthrough.controller.Detail"
	xmlns="sap.m"
	xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc">
	<Page
		title="{i18n>detailPageTitle}"
		showNavButton="true"
		navButtonPress=".onNavBack">
		<ObjectHeader
			intro="{invoice>ShipperName}"
			title="{invoice>ProductName}"/>
	</Page>
</mvc:View>
```

On the detail page, we tell the control to display a back button by setting the parameter `showNavButton` to true and register an event handler that is called when the back button is pressed.



## webapp/controller/Detail.controller.js

```js
sap.ui.define([
	"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller",
	"sap/ui/core/routing/History"
], (Controller, History) => {
	"use strict";

	return Controller.extend("ui5.walkthrough.controller.Detail", {

		onInit() {
			const oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();
			oRouter.getRoute("detail").attachPatternMatched(this.onObjectMatched, this);
		},

		onObjectMatched(oEvent) {
			this.getView().bindElement({
				path: "/" + window.decodeURIComponent(oEvent.getParameter("arguments").invoicePath),
				model: "invoice"
			});
		},

		onNavBack() {
			const oHistory = History.getInstance();
			const sPreviousHash = oHistory.getPreviousHash();

			if (sPreviousHash !== undefined) {
				window.history.go(-1);
			} else {
				const oRouter = this.getOwnerComponent().getRouter();
				oRouter.navTo("overview", {}, true);
			}
		}
	});
});

```

We load a new dependency called `History` that helps us to manage the navigation history from the `sap.ui.core.routing` namespace and add the implementation for the event handler to our detail page controller.

In the event handler we access the navigation history and try to determine the previous hash. In contrast to the browser history, we will get a valid result only if a navigation step inside our app has already happened. Then we will simply use the browser history to go back to the previous page. If no navigation has happened before, we can tell the router to go to our overview page directly. The third parameter `true` tells the router to replace the current history state with the new one since we actually do a back navigation by ourselves. The second parameter is an empty array \(`{}`\) as we do not pass any additional parameters to this route.

This implementation is a bit better than the browser's back button for our use case. The browser would simply go back one step in the history even though we were on another page outside of the app. In the app, we always want to go back to the overview page even if we came from another link or opened the detail page directly with a bookmark. You can try it by loading the detail page in a new tab directly and clicking on the back button in the app, it will still go back to the overview page.



## Conventions

-   Add a path to go back to the parent page when the history state is unclear.

## Data Binding for Facet Filters

`FacetFilter` fully supports the OpenUI5 data binding concept.

As the information for the facet filter usually resides in the application backend, data binding is commonly used to populate the `FacetFilter` properties and aggregations.

Applications using OData do not bind the `FacetFilterItem.selected` property since this is not available from the backend service. Fortunately, selections are maintained internally on the client by the `FacetFilterList` until the list is destroyed.

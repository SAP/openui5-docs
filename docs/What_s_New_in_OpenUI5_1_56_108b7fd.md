**New Event Handler Parameter Syntax** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**New Event Handler Parameter Syntax**

When event handlers are assigned to control events in XML views, you can now also specify parameters which can be passed to the event handler. The parameters can be static values as well as bindings and even expressions. This feature helps to reduce controller code and avoid unnecessary controller methods, and separates the controller logic from the retrieval of the required input values.

```xml
<Button text="Add Product" press=".modifyList('add ', ${products>unitPrice})"/>
```

For more information, see [Handling Events in XML Views](Handling_Events_in_XML_Views_b0fb4de.md).

**XML Composite Control**

A new type of composite control, the XML composite control, is now available. It let's you build more flexible controls that contain separate XML and JavaScript parts. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.core.XMLComposite) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.core.XMLComposite).

**Support Assistant**

The Support Assistant now allows you to import and export your rule selection. This helps you when you want to perform more than one analysis with the same subset of selected rules. The selection is exported as a `.json` file with a title and description of your choice. You can then import this file and load it whenever you want to execute the same rules in another analysis.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model has the following features:

-   Binding parameter `$$ownRequest` to enforce that a binding sends its own requests.

-   Binding parameter `$$aggregation` to display aggregated data.

    > ### Note:  
    > This feature is still a work in progress. So far it supports displaying a flat list of aggregated data or grouping by one groupable property without being able to expand.

-   The refresh of a single row in an absolute list binding can now also take filters into account .

-   When executing a deferred bound operation, the result of the promise returned by `v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` is the context representing the data of the bound operation response if certain conditions are fulfilled. For more information check the API for <code><a href="https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding/methods/execute"><code>ODataContextBinding#execute</code></a></code>.


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported together with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel) in the Demo Kit.

**Support Assistant** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**Support Assistant**

-   `sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope.getElements` has a new parameter `cloned`. It allows users of the Support Assistant to filter out elements that are clones of list bindings. Now the results will include only the representative clone. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.support.ExecutionScope/methods/Summary).

-   A *Filter* view showing the currently applied filter has been added to the *Issues* view of the Support Assistant. The *Clear Filtering* button \(![](images/loio4a0cf3bc3f7244549cf95901077aa6ae_HiRes.png)\) has moved to the *Filter* view. It is active only when there is a filter selected.

-   An explanatory note has been added to the *Additional Rulesets* view under the header to give more clarity about the function of these rulesets and why they are in a separate tab.

-   The *Report* button is now fixed to the panel to be always visible and not to get into the overflow.

-   The font sizes are aligned across all three views for consistency.

-   In the *Issues* view the number of issues is only highlighted when there are issues of medium and high severity. This improvement helps to easily see the distribution of the issues by severity.

-   A new `TabDensityMode` property is introduced in both `sap.m.IconTabBar` and `sap.m.IconTabHeader`. The property allows both the Tab Bar and the Header to change their density within different controls.

-   The new `appointmentDragEnter` event allows appointments to be dragged and dropped between calendar rows. By default, when the `enableAppointmentDragAndDrop` property is enabled, appointments can be dragged only within their original `PlanningCalendarRow`. When `enableAppointmentsDragAndDrop` is set to true, attaching the event handler to the `appointmentDragEnter` event can change the default behavior and allow appointments to be dragged on the same row and between calendar rows.

-   Appointments can now be created in one `PlanningCalendarRow` by dragging with the mouse on an empty cell. This behavior is enabled with the `enableAppointmentCreate` boolean property. When creating is finished, an `appointmentCreate` event is fired.

-   The new `enableAppointmentResize` boolean property provides the possibility to resize appointments in one `PlanningCalendarRow`. When resizing is finished, an `appointmentResize` event is fired.

-   A new functionality to copy appointments by dragging them is added on the `PlanningCalendarRow` level. When you press [Ctrl\]/[Cmd\] while dragging an appointment, dropping it will create a copy.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/sample/sap.m.sample.PlanningCalendarDnD/preview).

To make sure that all items in the table are loaded at once, and the above features work properly, you should set the growing property to `false`.

-   You can create a custom tooltip, by extending the class `sap.m.SliderTooltipBase` and overriding some methods. If you want to define your own content for the tooltip, you should override just the `renderTooltipContent` method.

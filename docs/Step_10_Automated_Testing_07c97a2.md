## Step 10: Automated Testing

In this step, we will step back from our tests and application features that we have implemented so far and take a closer look at another important piece of the test setup - the test automation. We will learn how to set up a basic test automation, which might be used in a continuous integration system or locally to run tests via shell.

### Automated Testing

Please, follow the steps described in [Test Automation](Test_Automation_ae44824.md#loioae448243822448d8ba04b4784f4b09a0) to configure an automated test setup.

**Parent topic:**[Testing Tutorial](Testing_Tutorial_291c912.md "In this tutorial we will test application functionality with the testing tools that are delivered with OpenUI5. At different steps of this tutorial you will write tests using QUnit, OPA5, and the OData V2 mock server. Additionally, you will learn about testing strategies, Test Driven Development (TDD), and much more.")

**Next:**[Step 9: Adding the Post Page](Step_9_Adding_the_Post_Page_4a9f063.md "Now that we have covered all kinds of tests for navigation, we introduce our Post page that shows details of a post in the bulletin board. To achieve this, we have to introduce a new view/controller pair and adjust the routing of the application.")

**Previous:**[Step 11: Testing User Input](Step_11_Testing_User_Input_92959b1.md "In this step, we will write a test that simulates a user search. We will enter the search string into the search field and check if the correct results are shown in worklist table.")

The test runner can be included in your project setup so that it is called whenever code changes are submitted.")

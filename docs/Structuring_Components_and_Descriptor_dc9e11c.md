## Structuring: Components and Descriptor

OpenUI5 provides Components as independent and reusable parts of UI5 applications. They facilitate the encapsulation of closely related parts of an application, thus enabling developers to structure and maintain their applications more easily.

Components are independent and reusable parts used in OpenUI5 applications.

The descriptor for applications, components, and libraries \(in short: app descriptor\) is inspired by the WebApplication Manifest concept introduced by the W3C. The descriptor provides a central, machine-readable, and easy-to-access location for storing metadata associated with an application, an application component, or a library.

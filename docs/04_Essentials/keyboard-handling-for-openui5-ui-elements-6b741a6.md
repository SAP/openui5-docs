## Keyboard Handling for OpenUI5 UI Elements

OpenUI5 UI elements provide keyboard handling in order to improve accessibility and speed up work.



### Keyboard Shortcuts for End Users

Some users operate their computer almost exclusively with the keyboard. For those users, focus is critical and the entire page functionality should be available using the keyboard. OpenUI5 supports keyboard navigation with a predefined tab order sequence.

In this topic we introduce the main keyboard combinations that are used by OpenUI5 UI elements.

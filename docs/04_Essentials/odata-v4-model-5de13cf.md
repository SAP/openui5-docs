# OData V4 Model

The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel` is the model implementation for consuming an OData V4 service.

> ### Note:  
> The interface for applications has been changed for an easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](changes-compared-to-odata-v2-model-abd4d7c.md).

The OData V4 model supports the following:

-   Read access

-   Updating properties of OData entities \(in entity sets and contained entities\) via two-way-binding

-   Deleting entities

-   Operation \(function and action\) invocation

-   Grouping data requests in a batch request

-   Server-side sorting and filtering


> ### Note:  
> The OData V4 model documentation contains several code samples. These refer to the [Sales Orders](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.SalesOrders) sample in the Demo Kit.

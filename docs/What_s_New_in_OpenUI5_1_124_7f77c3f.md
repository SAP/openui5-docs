We have extended the `MultiSelectionPlugin`: If the number of selected rows is smaller than the set limit of rows, all these rows can be selected at once with a single operation. If there are more rows than the set limit, the first x rows are selected until the limit x has been reached. Now a *Complete* icon is shown to indicate that all rows have been selected. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.table.plugins.MultiSelectionPlugin%23methods/setLimit) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.table.Table/sample/sap.ui.table.sample.MultiSelectionPlugin).

You can now use the*dts-generator* tool to generate TypeScript type definitions for any custom OpenUI5 library written in JavaScript. This is the same tool that is used for generating the productive type definitions for OpenUI5 and all its libraries.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   You can now use the experimental feature of moving nodes of a recursive hierarchy using`sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move` with any initial expansion state of the hierarchy. An expansion state can be provided via the `expandTo` property of either the `$$aggregation` binding parameter or the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation` API.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.Context#move`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move), [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList), and [`v4.ODataListBinding#setAggregation`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding%23methods/setAggregation).

-   If you move a node with the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#move` API and the moved node has siblings, it is now shown by default at a position assigned by the back end. Alternatively, you now have the option of moving the node to a position before a specified sibling or to the last position among its siblings.

    For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/move).

-   The tree state is now kept when sorting or filtering a recursive hierarchy.

-   We have introduced the new `$$clearSelectionOnFilter` list binding parameter. When a filter or search is changed, it allows you to automatically deselect records that were selected via the experimental `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setSelected` API.

    For more information, see the API Reference for [`v4.ODataModel#bindList`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel%23methods/bindList) and [`v4.Context#setSelected`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context%23methods/setSelected).

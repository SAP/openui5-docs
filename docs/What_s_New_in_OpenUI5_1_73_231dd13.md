`AvatarGroup` is used to display a group of related avatars, arranged horizontally. The control allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case. Two group types are available: `Group` and `Individual`.

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Binding of operation parameters as described in [OData Operations](OData_Operations_b54f789.md) in the OpenUI5 documentation.

-   Methods for finding bindings that have become public:

    -   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel#getAllBindings`
    -   `sap.ui.model.Binding#getPath` 
    -   `sap.ui.model.Binding#getContext`
    -   `sap.ui.model.Binding#getModel`


> ### Restriction:  
> Due to the limited feature scope of this version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model, check that all required features are in place before developing applications. Double-check the detailed documentation of the features, as certain parts of a feature may be missing. While we aim to be compatible with existing controls, some controls might not work due to small incompatibilities compared to `sap.ui.model.odata.(v2.)ODataModel`, or due to missing features in the model \(such as tree binding\). This also applies to controls such as `TreeTable` and `AnalyticalTable`, which are not supported in combination with the OpenUI5 OData V4 model. The interface for applications has been changed for easier and more efficient use of the model. For a summary of these changes, see [Changes Compared to OData V2 Model](Changes_Compared_to_OData_V2_Model_abd4d7c.md).

For more information, see [OData V4 Model](OData_V4_Model_5de13cf.md), the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v4), and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel).

**`sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`**

The `fitContent` property of the `sap.f.DynamicPage` control is now also exposed in `sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage`. It's used to optimize the responsiveness and behavior of the control and we recommend using this property when displaying content of adaptive controls that stretch to fill the available space.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage).

-   Critical
-   Negative
-   Success

We have updated the behavior of the `showItems` method. When the control's picker is opened, the dropdown arrow is not in pressed state, as it was previously. Now, pressing the dropdown arrow for the first time opens the control's picker with all items, and with the second press the picker is closed.

**`sap.m.NotificationListItem`, `sap.m.NotificationListGroup`**

We have redesigned the notifications, and now they are lighter, easy to use, and aligned with the SAP Fiori 3 user experience. The changes include:

-   The priority of the notifications is now visualized with a status icon.
-   Action buttons in the `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` could now be hidden.
-   Collapse/expand functionality of the `sap.m.NotificationListGroup` is implemented with an arrow button instead of text.
-   For the `sap.m.NotificationListGroup`, we have enabled an item counter, which represents the count of currently loaded items inside this group. It can be visible or hidden using the new `showItemsCounter` property.
-   The new `authorInitials` property is now introduced for `sap.m.NotificationListItem`. It is visualized as an avatar, and used as a fallback when the `authorPicture` is not provided. The background color of the avatar is chosen randomly.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.NotificationListGroup) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.NotificationListGroup).

**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

-   We have improved the support for the relative date ranges. This allows the card developers to use date ranges, such as `lastYear` or `nextQuarter` inside the card's manifest. Such automatically calculated date ranges can be used in data requests or other card attributes. For more information, see [Integration Card Date Range Handling](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/featureDateRangeHandling) in the Card Explorer.
-   We have added a new `format` namespace to hold formatters used in expression bindings, and added a predefined `date` formatter method to it. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/dateAndTime) in the Card Explorer.
-   The custom HTML element to consume cards on any web page is refactored. Now, height and width are specified in the standard CSS syntax and no longer as separate tag attributes. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/htmlConsumption) in the Card Explorer.

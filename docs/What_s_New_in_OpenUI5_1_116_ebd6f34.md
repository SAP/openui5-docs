**`sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card`**

We have \(experimentally\) introduced a new input field in the Object Card that enables users to enter a duration time interval. The value of the duration \(hours and minutes\) is stored in ISO 8601 duration format. For more information, see the [Object Card](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/learn/typesDeclarative/object) section and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/test-resources/sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/webapp/index.html#/explore/object/form) in the Card Explorer.

**`sap.m` library: Date- and time-related controls**

We have improved the placeholders of these controls in cases when the placeholders are not explicitly set. Previously the expected date format was used as a placeholder, but because it's a technical term, it could not be translated. Now the placeholder is a sample date in the required format, starting with *e.g.*, where *e.g.* is translatable. For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.DateTimePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePicker).

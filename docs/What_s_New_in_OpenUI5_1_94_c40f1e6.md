**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

We now provide the `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#isTransient` method, which returns information about whether an entity created on the client is not yet saved in the back-end system.

<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   Bound transition messages can now also be received in the `sap-messages` header. This can be useful if the payload, and hence any messages within the payload, is not available, for example in a success response of an action or function without corresponding return type. In this case, the server can send a bound transition message in the `sap-messages` header that the OData V4 model can forward to the message model.

-   XML templating can now process the `@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.DoNotCheckScaleOfMeasureQuantity` annotation. This annotation prevents the validation of the number of decimals.

-   A new `@$ui5.node.groupLevelCount` instance annotation for data aggregation scenarios. It represents the number of direct children of a group node. For more information, see [Data Aggregation and Recursive Hierarchy](Data_Aggregation_and_Recursive_Hierarchy_7d91431.md).

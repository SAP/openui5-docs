## Step 38: Build Your Application \(TypeScript\)

In this step we're going to build our application and consume the speed of a built OpenUI5 application.

### package.json

Now we create a production-ready version of our OpenUI5 application that can be deployed to a web server or any other platform. For this we introduce a new `build` script to the `package.json`. This script starts the `ui5 build` command, which initiates the build process using the UI5 build tool. It compiles and bundles all the necessary resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, into a deployable format. By adding the `--all` option to the build script, we specify that all available resources should be built including framework dependencies \(e.g. `sap.ui.core`, etc.\) .It ensures that all dependencies and resources required by the application are included in the final build. The `--clean-dest` flag tells the build tool to clean the destination folder before generating a new build. It ensures that any previous build artifacts are removed before the new build is created.

  "name": "ui5.walkthrough",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "UI5 TypeScript Walkthrough",
  "scripts": {
      "start": "ui5 serve -o test/mockServer.html",
      "build": "ui5 build --all --clean-dest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/openui5": "^1.120.0",
    "@ui5/cli": "^3.7.1",
    "@ui5/ts-interface-generator": "^0.8.1",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    "ui5-middleware-livereload": "^3.0.2",
    "ui5-middleware-serveframework": "3.0.0",
    "ui5-middleware-simpleproxy": "^3.2.8",
    "ui5-tooling-transpile": "^3.2.7"
  }
}
```

Now that we added this script to our project configuration, we also execute it:

Open a terminal and execute `npm run build` in the project root folder.

Congrats! You have successfully built your OpenUI5 application.

### Install a Local Web Server

To test the built result, we can serve the build output locally. To do this, we have to add a local web server hosting the built resources. For this tutorial we choose an npm package called [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server).

Therefore, we have to install the new package by executing `npm i -D local-web-server` in the project root folder.

To actually use the newly added web server, we have to add a new script to our `package.json` which we'll call `serve-dist`. This script starts the `local-web-server` by pointing to the OpenUI5 build output located in the `dist` folder of our project. The `--compress` flag specifies that the server should compress the data being transmitted to the client. It optimizes the responses sent by the server to the client. By adding the `--open` flag to the script we indicate that the server should automatically open a browser window or tab to the server's URL.

### package.json

```
{
  "name": "ui5.walkthrough",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "UI5 TypeScript Walkthrough",
  "scripts": {
      "start": "ui5 serve -o test/mockServer.html",
      "build": "ui5 build --all --clean-dest",
      "serve-dist": "ws --compress -d dist --open"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/openui5": "^1.120.0",
    "@ui5/cli": "^3.7.1",
    "@ui5/ts-interface-generator": "^0.8.1",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    "ui5-middleware-livereload": "^3.0.2",
    "ui5-middleware-serveframework": "3.0.0",
    "ui5-middleware-simpleproxy": "^3.2.8",
    "ui5-tooling-transpile": "^3.2.7"
  }
}
```

Now it's time to start the server by executing `npm run serve-dist` in a terminal in the project root folder. Your default browser opens automatically and the built application is hosted. The `local-web-server` does not offer proxy capabilities so far, nor does it allow to open a specific HTML file in the browser. To display any actual data, it is therefore necessary to open the `test/mockServer.html` file in the browser instead of the `index.html`.
